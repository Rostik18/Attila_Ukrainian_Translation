Їй-богу, твої слова — золота правда! Я згоден серцем і язиком з усім, що ви говорите!
Слава Господу! Він привів нас до мудрої мови і сердечної дружби! Погоджуюсь!
Господь зрадіє словам, які ми сьогодні промовили. Ви шануєте нас цими умовами.
Величний Боже! Засвідчіть, що моя честь незаплямована, навіть якщо я приймаю цю пропозицію, я повинен це зробити для свого народу!
Заради моїх людей, я приймаю. Якщо в цьому виборі є помилка, нехай Бог вкаже мені її.
Господь нахмуриться, що я прийняв такі мізерні умови. Але я роблю це, знаючи, що це необхідно.
Ваша пропозиція чесна і справедлива. Присягаюся, що з нашого боку все буде так, як ми домовилися.
Я відчуваю, що Господь посміхається нам і нашій згоді. Це почесна справа!
Дай вам Господь мудрості! І мій народ зустріне ваше прийняття з розпростертими руками!
Благородний вчинок, гідний ваших предків. Мій народ приймає вашу пропозицію.
Я буду молитися Господу і сподіватися, що він спостерігатиме за вами з цього дня й надалі.
Угоді кінець. Наші товари залишаться для наших людей і тих, хто справді знає їх ціну.
God give me strength! Have we jabbered on for so little result\?
Your words carry a weight of sadness. I hope the Lord gave you wisdom in this choice.
My belly rumbles for food, or a storm is brewing! On your head be it!
I am loyal to almighty God, but I fear their fury at this act of foolish men.
I fear the Heavenly Father will show his displeasure. And when that happens…
By God, we have war! Sound the horns! Sharpen the swords! You: pray for your souls!
In the names of our people and almighty God, greetings to our honoured friends!
Greetings! May the Almighty lend wisdom to my speech, and patience to your hearing!
I bring the blessings of God and my people. All look favourably upon you today.
May the Lord bless your patience and give me words that will gain your agreement.
I am sent to speak to you, and hear words. I must have offended the Lord to be given this reward!
I come to speak. Bah! Did I offend God to be given this weakling's work\?
I come to give of my word-hoard. Will you listen as I speak for my people\?
In the name of our people, greetings! I have words. And if God wills it they are words of friendship.
I greet you! May the Lord God bless our meeting.
The greetings of Christ to you. I carry my people's word-hoard, a gift for you.
My lord has talked to his wise woman. The crops may fail because your men show disrespect for Christ and his teachings! They must leave!
These lands are ours, by divine right. Now, will you aid the Lord\?
Gold, freely given and gratefully accepted, is a blessing from the Lord to all involved. So say the bones…
These people trouble even God himself! I beg you: march against them before it is too late!
The Lord has decreed that we must walk alone. The alliance is ended.
The time has come for bonds to be broken. In the name of the Saviour, so must it be.
My people no longer want your goods. They displease them, and God. Trade is done.
Christ has guided us to common sense and agreement. Now, some ale to guide our wits to sleep!
The Lord forbids me to say yes, for we have talked too much and said little.
The Lord test us with war! Now, take up the spear and come to our defence!
Our lands are closed to you. Your warriors must go. So speaks our noble God.
The Lord God gave use these lands. Hand them over, so that they can be properly ruled.
We are bonded by blood, honour and war. It is the will of God that you unite with us.
Are you fools\? Will you hold back when you can be a part of what is decreed by the Lord\?
We are children of the same blood! What sense is there in denying that we are one family\?
While the Lord in Heaven has no use for gold, he knows that his people must flourish and prosper on earth.
Our offer is fair and honourable. By God, all will be as we agree here!
No, no, no. The Lord would send a red plague upon us all if I agreed to such a thing.
My people cannot accept such an thing. The Lord would rightly curse us!
God will not allow this. For all its merits, it is not enough to calm his wrath.
To accept these terms would risk the wrath of both God and my people. I cannot act on this.
No, no, by God, no! One day your empty skull will find better use as a drinking cup!
God give me strength! No! O! How I long to strangle you with your own stinking guts!
God gave you bravery. I will give your manhood to my dogs after any more such witty offerings!
Our Saviour whispers to me that I must reject your offer, worthy though it was, and hope for something more.
The Lord would be displeased if I said yes too easily, although you speak your part well.
Drink, for the love of God, and stop talking for a moment! Your words make my skull throb and burn!
We have talked until God himself has fallen asleep. And to no purpose. We are finished.
Our Saviour has spoken, and has named you as true friends. Do we dare ignore the Lord God himself\?
The Lord speaks through thunder and storm, but tells us to ally with you, if you will have us…
Christ despairs of this bloodshed! We plead for an end to the wars between our peoples.
Only Satan celebrates this war and its suffering. I ask you to think of this, and give us peace.
Many warriors have gone to the afterlife. It is time to end the killing. It is time for peace.
The needs are my people are simple: some of your fine trading goods in exchange for our wares. Well\?
We can agree here, if the Lord wishes it, to proper treaties between our peoples.
I have listened to the word of our Lord and Saviour. He speaks of nothing but peace…
Our Lord demands an end to this wasteful war. Shall we have peace\?
The Lord tells us that we should offer you gold. We do not go against His word.
My friend! Be welcome! The blessings of Christ the Saviour to you.
Good and noble friend! What an honour you do us! Come, speak and let us hear your words!
God in Heaven… spare my arse! Well, why do you trouble my digestion today\?
We will gladly listen to your offers, but do not to wrap them in lies. The Lord knows truth.
The Lord will have me listen to you, but do not pass the day in words without merit.
You have the courage to ask this, yet cannot pick a sword to defend yourselves properly\? Good Lord!
Such grovelling would bring the fury of our maker upon us. And we would deserve His anger. As do you.
The Lord in Heaven would bring calamity upon us if we allowed such stupidity!
Your armies are not fit to march through God's land. You pollute His peace by even asking!
Do not ask such a thing! The Lord is quick to anger, and will demand blood!
These lands can never be yours! We will tear you to pieces rather than see the people submit!
It takes more than your stolen gold to win our favour. Give it to your false god!
The Lord tells us that our warriors cannot be wasted on these dogs. You must tame them without us.
Christ would weep, and rightly, to see us give up our freedom and become your dogs.
Our Saviour taught us wisdom. Armies can quickly turn to conquerors once they are inside the gates.
Ah, friend, by the Lord this is sorrowful. I was about to ask you the same thing!
Conscience would not let me rest easily if I gave you money and, in the doing, took honour.
No, no, no. The Almighty would be unhappy if we left. We have a duty to them.
We do not want peace. We want blood! And honour! And sacrifice!
I am sure that your wares will find a home somewhere, but not with us…
Our Lord is angry! Please, get your soldiers off our lands or suffer the endless curses of our honoured dead!
We do not ask it lightly, but the Lord favours it: an attack on these people would aid our cause!
Our Lord grows weary of your soldiers' tread! As you value friendship, remove your men from our lands.
Your warriors can march in our lands no longer. The Lord has spoken clearly on this matter.
Please, hand over these lands to our care. God would have it so.
The winds blow leaves where the Lord God wishes them sent. Will you let our warriors pass, like the leaves\?
We have noticed that our treasure stores are wanting. Can you help with this small matter\?
Stop! Stop! Even our merciful God grows weary listening to your bleating! Let me have ale now, not shrewish chit-chat!
War! Our Lord demands it. We love it. You, I expect to see mewling like a woman!
By the gods! I agree with all you say!
The gods have led us to wise speech! I agree!
I will take these words and put them before my people. There will be much feasting.
Yes! I knew your people to be fair.
You are a truly worthy friend!
You honour us with these terms.
Gods above! I accept this offer as I must for my people!
For my people, I accept.
I fear I betray my people by agreeing, but I have no words to oppose it.
For the good of my people I say yes, but I would have had more!
I dislike much of our speech, but I agree to what I must.
I have accepted paltry terms. But I do so knowing that it is necessary.
I accept. Let this be a sign of more good to come.
I swear by the gods that, for our part, all will be as we have agreed.
I can accept for my people knowing that good will come of the day.
I can sense that my gods smile upon us.
This is fair to my people.
I will show wisdom and accept your terms.
We are in agreement. So, where's the wine\?
Wisdom and strength: we have agreement.
You have the iron strength of the sword within your heart!
My people will feast handsomely because of this news!
My people will greet your acceptance!
Talk can be tasteless, but we have agreement here.
My words were heard in good faith then. You have proved worthy with this acceptance.
You speak wisely, and I am honoured with this agreement.
My people value strength and courage, but wisdom too should be admired.
My thanks for your words of agreement.
My people welcome this gift.
The gods and my people accept your offering.
This is a worthy tribute. I gladly accept it for my people.
My people will serve you with all our strength, as our ancestors would wish.
We lend our honour and warriors to your cause.
We will wisely bend before the storm. We will serve you.
Very well. We will hunt different prey!
We hear your words.
Like carrion birds, may your enemies now circle!
So be it. You must walk your own path.
We will respect your words, but your enemies will be sharpening their swords…
May your gods watch over you from this day on.
So be it. Your lands are yours alone once more.
As you wish. Our warriors will find other paths.
You trouble me, but we will do as you ask.
Our traders will look elsewhere for wealth. Have yours do the same.
Ha! Real men trade blows, not trinkets and baubles.
Dealing is done. Our wares will be kept for those who know their worth.
Our warriors will go. Let us hope that you see the folly of this one day!
We will leave your lands. Look to your own defences.
As you wish. We will march away. A pity, for your warriors still had much to learn…
Wine is of little comfort when talking results in nothing.
Gods give me strength! Have we jabbered on for so little result\?
I hope your gods gave you wisdom in this choice.
Your goatish stubbornness has killed all appetite!
I spoke with an honest tongue and trusted you.
The gods prepare a storm! On your head be it!
This is troubling. You have rejected the word of my people.
I am loyal to my mighty gods, but I fear their fury at this foolish act.
I fear my ancestors will speak of their displeasure. And when that happens…
War it shall be! We prefer the sharp sword to the lying tongue!
Very well. Swords will be burnished! We will have glory!
Our warriors will march and our women will prepare the victory feast for their return!
Our young crave the chance to become warriors! Your blood will wash away their youth!
Good! Our warriors grew restless. Cutting your throats will be an end to boredom!
By the gods, we have war! Sound the horns! Sharpen the swords! You: pray to your foul gods…
We will go to war then. Prepare your souls. You go to meet your ancestors!
War! Ah, a good word. Honest. Our men will take your heads...
Have your women bid farewell to their men, for their heads will decorate our standards!
The storm is coming. Your people will have never seen the like. Run for cover!
In the names of our people and our gods: greetings!
I came to share wisdom and, perhaps, reach agreement.
May our mighty gods lend wisdom to my speech, and patience to your hearing!
You are worthy for listening to my words, spoken in hope, for my people.
My gods and my people look favourably upon you today.
May the gods give me words that will gain your agreement.
I hope my words will be heard with kindness.
I am thankful that I have your ear, and hope that I can speak the right words.
I have been chosen by my people as a tongue for their words. Hear me, then, with honesty…
I bring the greetings of my ancestors! I have much to say, if you will but listen…
I am sent to speak to you. I must have offended the gods to be given this reward!
Bah! How many of the gods did I offend to be given this weakling's work\?
I’m here with all the enthusiasm of a lame horse, buckling under unfair burden. Hear my words…
I would sooner fill my belly than bandy with words! But speak I must!
I will speak plainly and quickly.
I am cursed because I must speak with you. Do not make me waste breath.
I would sooner face demons than deal with you, but such is my fate.
Few among my people envy me today. And having smelled you, I begin to understand why…
I am not known for a patient or kindly nature, so listen as I speak. And then agree!
I like an axe or sword better than weak words, so you would do well to agree today!
Will you listen as I speak for my people and my gods\?
I have words. And if the gods will it they are words of friendship.
I greet you! May the gods of fellowship bless our meeting.
I hope my words find willing ears and wise hearts.
The greetings of the gods to you. Will you listen\?
I ask only that you listen. I am the messenger for my people, and of honoured ancestors.
I bring you word from our people, delivered with truthful tongue.
I am to speak of agreements with you, honourably offered and honourably received.
My people are not word wastrels. We speak to the point but with honesty.
If you would hear my words, then I speak with the voice of my people.
Our warriors hunger for battle, blood and glory! Shall we attack these feeble fools\?
Our warriors, both proven and young, have a taste for battle. Give us word, and we will attack these people!
We stand ready to give these people fire and sword, pain and death. What say you\?
Can you not attack these folk\?
I call now for you to take to arms against these human wolves. Give your warriors leave to fight!
Are you honest warriors\? Will you send your spears against these enemies\?
I ask for my people, not myself. What help can you send\?
Our foes circle like wolves. My people fear, and I must beg help from you.
Our defences are weak. Can you send men to help against the foe\?
The plains, hills and valleys weep at your tread. Please: your soldiers must leave our lands. Now.
The crops may fail because your men dishonour our gods! They must leave!
My long-dead ancestors are uneasy. Your armies wake them. Can your warriors not go elsewhere\?
Our forefathers had a vision that they would rule these lands. Would you deny prophecy\?
I request that we are given these lands. Would you refuse so small a thing\?
Our gods have spoken clearly: these lands are ours, by divine right. Now, will you aid the gods\?
Do not let our peoples be separated. United in greatness, do we not all gain\?
My people treasure the bond between us. Will you join us\?
We choose friends with care. Are we not closer than brothers\?
I ask that my people's warriors may come and go so that they may fall upon our joint enemies!
Our warriors will trouble neither man nor beast in your lands…
Will your people let us enter your lands\? We seek nothing else from you.
My lord's needs are simple, and could be easily met with payments.
We might see you as worthy if you contribute to our treasure-stores.
You have gold aplenty. We would think well of you if you were to give us some.
Gold is a blessing from the gods to all involved.
All we ask is a small amount of wealth. You will hardly notice it…
Can you not spare some of your vast wealth for us\?
My people are in danger! Join with us and attack these dogs!
Will you send your famous generals against these people, who blight our lives\?
These people trouble even the gods! March against them before it is too late!
Why keep a treaty with these hateful wretches\? They are a byword for evil and deceit!
Do not waste friendship on these ungrateful dogs! These creatures will turn on you!
Do not remain tied to these wicked folk. Your people are better than that, as you must surely know!
Join your mighty strength with ours in this struggle. I ask for my people's sake.
Your men will turn the enemies' bowels to water! Come, aid us in this war!
I wonder why you stand aside from this war. You must fight!
We must walk alone. The alliance is ended.
We have been bound in friendship, but now we must walk towards our own fates.
Now the ancestors tell us to stand alone. We are done with you.
You must find your own feast. Our treaties and agreements are done.
The time has come for bonds to be broken. So speak our gods, and so must it be.
Our unquiet ancestors tell us to put aside friendship. This we will do.
Your warriors have walked in our lands. Now the ancestors are restless. Walk there no more.
Our lands are closed to you. March no more in our hunting grounds. I have spoken.
Your men are outlanders, and the ancestors have become disturbed. Your armies must no longer march in our lands.
My lord has ordered that your merchants must leave. It will be done.
Your goods displease our people and our gods. Trade is done.
We see no good coming from trade with you.
I will accept your proposal. Come! To the wine!
Your mouth talks well. Let us see if your belly can hold wine!
We have talked long to reach agreement. Now we must drown ourselves in wine! Ha!
Now, we have talked long, but we have agreement. I am content with the day.
The spirits have guided us to agreement.
You speak well, but can you drink and feast as cleverly to seal our bargain\? We shall see!
An end to over-long talk! Your offer is not what I want to hear! My ears yearn for silence!
Your speech holds much that is good for your people hidden in many words, but less for mine. I say no.
The gods forbid me to say yes, for we have talked too much and said little.
My belly grumbles. We must talk no more. The day is done.
I have been saddened not to find agreement here today.
I find but scant meat stuck to your bony words. We have nothing more to talk about!
You have fearsome foes. Will you send away our warriors if they come to help\?
We could lend our might to your cause. Say but one word, and we will come!
We need the glory of battle! Let us stand with you against these darkling foes!
When do you attack these people\? It is a simple warrior's question!
You stand idle while these cattle ticks burrow deep! Do you lack the courage for war\?
How long can you let these rats run free\? When will you stamp on them\?
We expect your help against these people. That is the price of brotherhood!
When storm clouds gather, we look for shelter and help. It is time for you to be helpful…
The gods test us with war! Now, come to our defence!
Our lands are closed to you. Your warriors must go. So speak our ancestors.
Our patience with your errant warriors is done. They are no longer welcome in our lands.
We grow tired of cursing your armies in our lands. We want rid of these thieves!
You do not need these lands. Our people need these lands. Be reasonable, and give them to us.
The gods gave us these lands. Hand them over, so that they can be properly ruled.
These lands will be ours. Hand them over, or our people's resentment may be too strong to control.
Join with us. It is right and proper, and the ancestors long gone will be pleased.
We are bonded by blood and war. It is the will of the gods that you unite with us.
Are you fools\? Will you hold back when you can be a part of what is decreed by the gods\?
Our warriors will come and go as they please. Be wise, and stand aside at your border.
Our warriors will pass through your lands. Be wise, and leave the door ajar…
Our warriors have no quarrel with you, and honour your courage, but they must march where they will…
Blood calls out to blood. Be wise, and let us come together as one people for the good of all!
We are children of the same gods! What sense is there in denying that we are one family\?
The wolves run in the dark all around. You need the protection of your brothers, don't you\?
Be wise! Accept your new masters!
My people are wise and worthy masters. Be wise, and take the expected oaths. You can still prosper.
Your freedom means less than nothing when you die in fear. Give it up, and live, with new masters…
We are not merchants, but we understand gold. We understand that it turns aside many swords.
Opulence is for the greedy, yet we still have use for gold. Indeed, we could use your gold…
Is it the act of a brother to keep such wealth as yours entirely to yourselves\?
Our warriors thirst for your blood and hunger for your women. Perhaps they can be distracted by gold…
The love of gold can stir evil in men. Give us your gold. Avoid the evil it brings…
While the ancestors have no use for gold, they know their living children think differently…
It is time to talk like men. We can put aside swords for the time it takes to speak a word or two.
I set aside my sword, to speak to you, warrior to warrior. This is the way of the world, for men.
I offer this in the name of our people. Let this be a sign of goodwill to come.
Our offer is fair and honourable. By the gods, all will be as we agree here!
Consult your ancestors, but you will see the merit in the offer I bring from my people.
I speak as the sword cuts: directly to the bone of the matter. Listen, and give agreement.
I am not here to burden you with demands. My offer is worthy of your people.
We do not have the civilized graces but we offer our words honestly, from the heart.
It is the nature of warriors to cut to the heart of anything. Consider this proposal carefully.
I do not hold with overlong talk, preferring the axe's edge as an argument. So listen, and then agree…
No, no, no. The gods would set a red plague upon us all if I agreed to such a thing.
My people cannot accept such an thing. The gods would rightly curse us!
My people deserve better of you than these words. Are we not men\?
I cannot take such an arrangement to my people, it would betray their faith in me.
There is no joy in this. I see no gain in these terms for my people.
This is not pleasing. My people deserve more from me.
This is not enough. I cannot take these terms before my people. You must do better.
The gods will not allow this. For all its merits, it is not enough to calm them.
I would risk the wrath of my gods and my people. I cannot act on this.
We must talk further. I am yet to hear words that meet with the needs of my people.
Bah! In another place my sword would take your head or manhood for such words!
No, no, by the gods, no! One day your empty skull will find better use as a drinking cup!
Still your flapping tongue, or my knife will find good use!
One more proposal like that and I will have you thrown to starving pigs.
No! O! How I long to strangle you with your own stinking guts!
So, you pour fine, civilized wine for yourselves, and a cup of piss for us\? No!
I hope you soon speak with your mewling ancestors!
A piss on your offer! And a piss on your slave-born ancestors too!
Do you think me mad\? No\? Are you sure\?
I will give your manhood to my dogs after another such offering!
The ancestors do not approve. I cannot go against such portents.
I must reject your offer, worthy though it was, and hope for something more.
Your people are a byword for honour, but I cannot quite accept the terms that you offer.
You speak from deep wisdom although the offer is but shallow. I cannot agree.
I fear our ancestors' unhappiness if I accepted, generous as your offer seems.
I cannot agree, even though the smell of the feast is most excellent.
I cannot settle on such terms. Your people are worthy, but my people deserve better of our talk.
The gods would be displeased if I said yes too easily, although you speak your part well.
You have an honest tongue, and so I reject your offer hesitantly, and without wishing offence.
You speak well, but I must be unswayed by all except the interest of my people.
Endless chit-chat is burdensome and womanly! Your words fill my ears and offer little of worth!
Stop talking for a moment! Your words make my skull throb and burn!
This talk has kept me from a warm woman! Your words weary my ears.
Enough, enough! My head buzzes with words, like too many angry bees!
We have talked until the gods themselves have fallen asleep. And to no purpose. We are finished.
You lay siege to my head with your words! I am done with talk!
You are worthy and strong, and only fools would not wish to be friends with you.
As clouds gather, wise men look for shelter. In you, I believe we have found such a thing.
Our ancestors have spoken, and they have named you as true friends.
No warrior likes standing alone in battle. Should we not watch for each other\?
In this time of darkness you can be the light for my people. I ask for a treaty…
The gods speak through thunder and storm, but they tell us to ally with you…
Our gods despair of this bloodshed! Please, an end to the wars between our peoples.
My people appeal for a settlement that will end the hostility.
Only the dark gods celebrate this war and its suffering. I ask you to give us peace.
You are a worthy foe, but the killing must end. Will you not give us peace\?
Many warriors have gone to the afterlife. It is time for peace.
Too much that was good has been lost. I beg now for peace.
We only ask that there can be trade between us.
Words can be all that is between people, but we would like trade as well, if you agree it…
The needs of my people are simple: some of your goods in exchange for our wares. Well\?
We could be friends. Then I wouldn't have to kill you. Just enemies.
We want you as friends of our people. So will you accept the hand of friendship\?
Will you be counted as friends, or will you walk into a dark future\?
We could stand together, our blades in hand, and defy the world!
I ask you to be our allies. Come now, be brave!
Carrion birds gather. Swords are being sharpened. This is not the time to stand alone.
There is a time when warriors must sheathe the sword, and talk, for the good of their people.
Only the greatest dare speak of peace to their enemies. Only the weak seek the death of all.
The sword was drawn, but now it is blooded. End this feud. We offer peace today, or the sword tomorrow.
We come to speak words of strength. Reply, then, with the strength that welcomes peace.
Shall we hack at each other, until our enemies can gorge themselves on warriors' flesh\? Or will it be peace\?
Our struggle will end badly for all. I suggest peace. What say you\?
My lord's offer is simple: trade. You have much that we want. So, what say you\?
Trade is what concerns me today. It can bring prosperity to all!
My offer is a straight-shot arrow. My people want your trade goods. What say you\?
My people have little need for these lands. We offer them to you.
These lands and people are unworthy of us. Do you want them\?
These lands are yours, if you wish. We would be rid of them, and every bastard dwelling there.
I do not think this is a good idea, but... we will offer you gold, much gold.
We have spoils to share with you, worthy warriors.
I am not always thought generous among my people, and do not easily give coin away.
We can agree here to proper treaties between our peoples.
My ancestors have spoken well of you, and so we offer a treaty.
Brothers are stronger when they stand together.
This is a time for the proud to unite in strength.
The hungry dogs are all around. The wise man bars his door and looks for allies.
Our ancestors see greatness in you…
I have listened to the ancestors. They speak of nothing but peace…
Strength has been shown by the living and the dead. Now it is time to set aside war…
Our rivals circle like carrion crows, and we fight on to give them meat. We should have peace.
Our gods think this war is wasteful. Shall we have peace\?
How much blood must we spill before we find wisdom\?
Do we fight until both of us are on our knees\?
A river of goods and coin between our lands would surely see all prosper\?
We both would surely benefit if we agreed to open trade. Well\?
We have fine goods and you have much that we want in return. So, are we to have trade\?
I offer this morsel. Now, like a wolf at the door, perhaps you will go find better hunting\?
The ancestors tell us that we should offer you gold. We do not argue with them.
My people wish to offer you this gift of gold, if you will take it.
Let us have good wine until we can talk no more!
I have called for good wine to ease your throat, and ripe women also!
Let us break bread and drink before words pass our lips!
You honour us! There is food enough for two armies awaiting us when we have talked!
We will talk, and then we will feast!
My friend! Be welcome! The ancestors smile upon you!
What an honour you do us! Come, speak!
There is fine meat roasting for you, and wine also, but first, we talk!
Before I hear your wisdom I trust you will not object to a cup of wine\?
We have need of talk, I am sure. And also wine.
Speak ill or slowly and I may feed your tongue to the dogs.
Well, why do you trouble my digestion today\?
Speak, I will listen before I turn you inside out!
What you say had better please my ears!
Please, don't bother with meaningless pleasantries. Talk of meat, not honey.
Speak. Do not waste time better spent hunting.
My time is better spent hunting than listening, so be quick with your chattering.
Do not waste words. My people are worthy of better.
I warn you that I have no stomach for the meek or nice.
Do not attempt to sweeten truth with honey. Speak plainly. Flatter, and you fail…
Speak plainly, for we are honest people who value it in others.
Let your words move me to anger or agreement, as you wish of them!
My ancestors and people expect talk with purpose and honesty.
We will gladly listen to your offers, but do not to wrap them in lies.
A flapping tongue that speaks without wisdom is not welcome.
Speak plainly and without idle purpose and all will be well.
We will speak together of whatever you wish, but bring words that can warm our hearts.
I listen because your people are known to have honour.
The gods will have me listen to you, but do not speak words without merit.
I trust you come with honourable words that I can hear kindly\?
Why\? Why would warriors do such a thing to people who are no real threat\?
It is true, we glory in battle but we are not murderers in the dark. Find other tame killers...
We are not a club in your hands to bludgeon your enemies. If they offend you, kill them yourselves!
So… We fight your enemies while you hide, grow fat, and whore yourselves stupid. An excellent plan! Bah!
My people are not your shield. Are you so sunk in cowardice\? You are geldings indeed, then!
You have the courage to ask this, yet cannot pick a sword to defend yourselves properly\? Great gods!
Us\? We should serve you\? As your tethered goats\? Your dogs\? Your slaves\? Your head injury goes unhealed, then!
I say my defiance is as sharp as a sword, as true as the arrow, as strong as a stallion!
My people bow to no man, least of all the snivelling weaklings that pass as your rulers!
I will not hand over our people to your keeping. I would die of shame!
Such grovelling would bring the fury of the gods upon us. And we would deserve their anger. As do you.
Only a goat eats everything within reach! You were birthed by a goat! You smell like one as well!
The gods and our ancestors long dead would strangle us in the night if we allowed such a stupidity!
Our lands would never be rid of the stench. You may not march in them.
Your armies are not fit to march where our gods still live. You pollute their peace by even asking!
Gold\? Is that all you value\? You shall have none from us, only rich contempt!
We do not pay wolves to keep them from our flocks. When we can be bothered, we hunt them.
Spare you some gold\? You have so little honour, then, that you beg at table for scraps. Away, cur!
The only gold I will give you is the piss from my slaves, and I begrudge you even that!
The feeble and weak-willed may throw you meat, but we do not hold with feeding stray dogs.
You think me a fool then\? Or my people\? Or our ancestors\? One coin, and your begging would never end!
A fancy word for slavery! Keep your whips and chains for your own household, or your wife.
We do not bow before foreign dogs. I would sooner throw my family into the flames than do such a thing!
You folk, our masters\? Fool! Away, back to the other madmen!
Do not ask such a thing! The gods are quick to anger, and will demand blood!
These lands can never be yours! The gods would tear you to pieces rather than see the people submit!
You\? Rule these...\? It is true then. Madness runs in your people. But... you don't foam at the mouth…
What\? Such wit will one day surely cost you your head! Let me take it now, and save you trouble!
Do I look like some civilized city whore\? Do I\? Well, why do you try to use me like one\?
Ally with gutless wonders such as you\? My people deserve better. You deserve a spear point for the idea.
We are warriors not weaklings. Look to your own defences!
What do we gain from this\? Friends\? No!
You pitiful wretches have a sense of humour. I would as soon ally with week-dead fish. Their stink is better!
Peace\? Peace\? I laugh at your peace! We do not make peace with fish-faced fools!
Peace is not to our taste. We like the screams of your women! Not peace!
Peace\? Be grateful I do not have your peaceful tongue ripped from your head for speaking such a word!
My ancestors were quite… inventive with dolts like you. They used fire, and skinning knives. Peace\? I spit on you.
What\? Peace\? When your skulls are as yet unstacked, and your women have yet to kill themselves in despair\?
I cannot stomach your cowardice. Your people will have peace. When they are all stacked on the funeral pyres!
Trade\? Do you think us children, flattered and distracted by your pretty beads\? Bah!
Your coins have your ugly-faced rulers on them. None of my people want them in their purses.
You think to turn our heads with your unholy trinkets\? Save them for the little boys you favour…
So, you think we will sell ourselves, like your women\? You are truly mad, then, or stupid!
Keep your money. You will need it to pay your way to the afterlife. And it is tainted anyway…
It takes more than your stolen gold to win our favour. Give it to your remarkably foul gods!
Be grateful that you are not eating this mighty treasure, piece by piece!
We do not want your money. Use it to build temples to your false gods!
Your money may win favour among whores but we will not be used for your filthy pleasure.
Our warriors are needed elsewhere, and even the sharpest sword cannot be thrust into two enemies at once.
The spirits tell us that our warriors cannot be wasted on these dogs. You must tame them without us.
There is glory in what you ask, but our path goes a different way.
The plan is good, but we cannot send warriors to help in defence. Our ancestors are against it.
I will not promise much and give little. We cannot help. You must stand without us.
My people cannot move at every wolf howl. We wait to see what the pack is doing.
Our gods would weep to see us give up our freedom and become your dogs.
I will not offer up my people as sacrifices to your glory. Ancestors! Strike me down if I ever do!
I will never ask my people to bow to you. Never. Our hard-won freedom remains ours!
We value our freedom. We cannot set it aside to become slaves!
My people still have the strength to stand alone, and the stubbornness to reject such an offer.
We are set in our ways, for they served us and our ancestors well. We cannot join with you.
Our gods taught us some wisdom.  Armies can quickly turn to conquerors once they are inside the gates.
No. The ancestors would sleep poorly if your men were tramping across our lands.
In winter the wise man closes his doors and keeps out the fierce winds that blow.
You people are reduced to begging for scraps at others' doors\?
By the ancestors, this is sorrowful. I was about to ask you the same thing!
Your war-chest may be empty, but you look to the wrong men if you hope to fill it.
Ha! Away with your foolishness, before you feel a golden boot at your arse, emissary or no!
The ancestors would not let me rest easily if I gave you money!
Where have you put your people's pride\? Is it eaten by wolves, or pecked away by carrion birds\? Gold\? No.
No! I would not give over even the meanest of our people to your considerate mastery.
My ancestors roil in their sleep! That such an offer is made... I must reject your demand.
Where is worth in this\? You gain rebellion, dissent and bitterness within your walls. We gain nothing.
I think not. Blood and treasure bought us those lands, and we value them.
No, no, no. We have a duty to our ancestors.
No. The sword can only be taken from our cold, dead hands.
A man is judged by his friends. This is not the time for such an agreement.
In all truth I cannot say Yes. That sits ill with me, so I say No.
We have no need to share our glory with you.
We are not wet nurses for weaklings!
Our ancestors were proud men, and stood alone against the world. Can we do any less\?
The man who hangs upon the shield of another is nothing but a burden.
Ah, you joke, even in this! I admire your people for their sense of humour!
You are a funny little man. And we do listen to what funny little men want.
Silence has not yet fallen. It is not the season for peace.
I expected such an offer, but not so soon. My people still enjoy the taste of glory…
This is not a time of peace. When the moon has waxed and waned, then, maybe…
Our gods do not want peace. Our gods want blood! And sacrifice! We do what the gods ask…
I do not think our people want your trinkets. They like honest, manly stuff for the most part.
Your wares will find a home somewhere, but not with us…
We see little gain in trade between our peoples.
I am sure that money means a great deal to you. But we value only glory!
Our ancestors were never beggars or servants. And we will not become your paid hirelings.
We are not farmhands or hired killers, to be given a little bread in exchange for obedience.
You have the heart of a merchant. We do not want your gold.
A tidy sum, but our hearts are full of courage, not lust for gold.
Our ancestors would be shamed if even one of your coins was accepted. They were proud, our ancestors…
Our ancestors are restless! Please, get your soldiers off our lands or suffer the endless curses of our honoured dead!
Your armies must go. One. Two. Three. Four... Five… Have your warriors left our lands yet\? Six… Seven…
Your armies must leave our lands. The stench alone causes sows to miscarry, and all our sheep look nervous!
The gods favour it: an attack on these people would aid our cause!
Will you not use your courage to help us\? Attack these people!
Can you spare men to cut a few throats\? These people need death at your hands…
I speak now of our need for more warriors, to defend against these people.
Dogs circle us and bare their teeth. We need a friend or two to watch our backs…
A wise man looks to his brother to bring a bucket when the floods come!
Our gods grow weary of your soldiers' tread! Remove your men from our lands.
Your warriors can march in our lands no longer. The ancestors have spoken clearly on this matter.
We have been quiet for a long time, but now it is time for your warriors to go home.
My people would take it as a great kindness if you gave us these lands. And kindnesses are always remembered.
These lands have worth for my people. Let us make something of them and we will all surely prosper.
Please, hand over these lands to our care. The ancestors would have it so.
War makes strange demands on friendship: let our warriors pass through your lands.
The winds blow leaves where the sky wishes them sent. Will you let our warriors pass, like the leaves\?
Our warriors tread many paths, may they enter your lands\?
When all follow one banner, the everlasting sky will shake at our approach!
The time has come to join with us, to form a permanent bond that goes beyond friendship.
Let our peoples be united! Together we can find glory unmatched by any rival!
Our people go hungry, and you have much. Would you share with another fallen on hard times\?
I make a simple request: can you not spare some gold for my people\?
My ancestors were practical men when they lived. For good reasons, then, I ask you for some gold.
Will you not give our people a little gold\? You have much, and we will not become the slaves of envy!
The ancestors have noticed that our treasure stores are wanting. Will you help with this small matter\?
A token, perhaps a gift of coin, and my people would see you in a new light…
You are known as people of wealth and worth. A small gift would make you generous as well!
I ask that you give my people a gift, a token, of friendship.
You enjoy a fine reputation among my people already, but a gift would make your worth clear even to doubters!
Even the gods grow weary listening to your bleating! Let us have no more shrewish chit-chat!
Even your God of Gossiping Women must have grown weary listening to your endless drone! Stop!
You have said much, and nothing at all. Enough, then…
Our talk has gone back and forth without result. It is time to stop.
My head is fogged with your words, and I have heard nothing of worth. Still your tongue.
Your talk has wandered along too many paths. No more talk today!
Ah! War! Good! I await the sound of your screams on the morning air!
At the end of the warriors' road stands your funeral pyre. I will bring the torch!
A man's calling is war, not weakling's gossip! Give me the clash of swords, not wagging tongues!
We will make your homes a wasteland, despoil your women, enslave your children and desecrate your ancestor's graves!
Fear is your lot! Now come the ravens, beaks agape for your guts, eager for our sword-work!
Enjoy this quiet time. It ends now. The storm is coming, a storm of blood to wash you away!
You fear us. It is in your eyes, in your stench. And you are right to fear. War comes.
We live for battle, we dream of it, we relish it!
Our gods demand it. Our ancestors love it. War!
We will come for you, in the night, and nothing will live. Not one creature. That is our war.
By all the gods, your word-hoard is golden truth! I agree with my heart and tongue to all you say!
All praise to the gods! They have led us to wise speech and heart-felt friendship! I agree!
I will take word of our agreement and put it before my people. They will  feast in celebration!
Yes! Your words show wisdom beyond your years. I knew your people to be honourable!
This agreement is like a feast after an empty belly! You are a truly worthy friend!
The gods will rejoice at the words we have spoken today. You honour us with these terms.
Gods above! Witness that my honour is unstained, even as I accept this offer as I must for my people!
For my people, I accept. If there is fault in this choice, let the gods find it in me.
I fear I betray my people by agreeing, but I have no army of words to oppose it.
For the good of my people I say yes, but I would have had more from our talk!
I dislike much of our speech, but I put aside my concerns and agree to what must be agreed.
The gods will frown that I have accepted such paltry terms. But I do so knowing that it is necessary.
I accept in the name of our people. Let this be a sign of more good to come.
Your offer is fair and honourable. I swear by the gods that, for our part, all will be as we have agreed.
You have spoken fairly, and I can accept for my people knowing that good will come of the day.
I can sense that my gods smile on us and our agreement. This is an honourable thing!
This is fair to my people. All that’s left is to drink until we roll beneath the benches!
You bless our meeting with these terms. I will show wisdom and accept them.
Much talk can be wearisome, unless it brings agreement, as here. So, where's the wine\?
Wisdom and strength: together in the service of our people we have agreement.
You have the iron strength of the sword within your heart to speak such wise words! Excellent!
Excellent! My people will feast me handsomely because of this news!
The gods bless you with wisdom! And my people will greet your acceptance with arms outstretched!
Talk can be tasteless, but when we have agreement it makes wine sweeter and gives meat savour!
My words were heard in good faith then. You have proved worthy with this acceptance.
You speak wisely, like a man of many winters, and I am honoured with this agreement.
My people value strength and courage, but wisdom too should be admired.
Much ale will be swilled thanks to  your words of agreement. My thanks!
A fine gesture. My people welcome this gift and will hold you in high regard.
A noble act worthy of your ancestors. The gods and my people accept your offering.
By the spear! This is a worthy tribute. I gladly accept it for my people.
My people will serve you with honour and all our strength, as our ancestors would wish it so.
We give our oaths to you and your people, and lend our honour and warriors to your cause.
We are a proud people but, like the ash, we also wisely bend before the storm. We will serve you.
Very well. We will hunt different prey, and take our own trophies!
Strength and courage in friends is not easily replaced, but we hear your words.
We will walk different roads, then. Like carrion birds, your enemies may now circle!
So be it. A shield-brother who walks his own path will not always be a stranger…
We will respect your words. Our warriors are mighty men, though, and your enemies will be sharpening their swords…
I will pray to the gods and hope they watch over you from this day on.
So be it. Your lands are yours alone once more. Let us hope there is wisdom in this.
As you wish. Our warriors will find other paths and not trouble you or your homely women again.
You trouble me, but we will do as you ask. Our warriors will go another way.
Our traders will look elsewhere for wealth, and trouble you no more. Have yours do the same.
There was no honour in swapping baubles anyway. Real men trade blows, if only in the practice circle!
Dealing is done. Our wares will be kept for our people and those who truly know their worth.
Our warriors will go. Let us hope that you see the folly of this one day!
We will leave your lands. Look to your own defences. Oh, and your wives to their own menfolk!
As you wish. We will march away. A pity, for your warriors still had much to learn…
The best ale is of little comfort to a dry throat when talking results in nothing.
Gods give me strength! Have we jabbered on for so little result\?
Your words carry a weight of sadness. I hope your gods gave you wisdom in this choice.
My people looked for a feast tonight, but your goatish stubbornness has killed all appetite!
I spoke with an honest tongue, and trusted you to find the warrior's worth in my words.
My belly rumbles for food, or the gods prepare a storm! On your head be it!
This is troubling. You have rejected the word of my people. Unhappiness will flow from this day.
I am loyal to my mighty gods, but I fear their fury at this act of foolish men.
I fear my ancestors and spirits of the land will speak of their displeasure. And when that happens…
War it shall be! We are honest folk and prefer the sharp sword to the lying tongue!
Very well. The word-hoard will be locked away, and swords and shields burnished! We will have glory!
Our warriors will march and our women will prepare the victory feast for their return!
Our young warriors crave the chance to earn their rights as men! Your blood will wash away their youth!
Good! Our warriors grew restless. Cutting your throats will be an end to boredom!
By the gods, we have war! Sound the horns! Sharpen the swords! You: pray to your foul gods…
We will go to war then. Prepare your souls. You go to meet your ancestors!
War! Ah, a good word. Honest. Our men will take your heads... a pity you are not a handsome people!
Have your women bid farewell to their men, for your heads will decorate our standards!
The storm is coming. Your people will have never seen the like. Run for cover!
In the names of our people and our gods, greetings to our honoured friends!
I came to unlock my word-hoard, and share wisdom at your table and, perhaps, reach agreement.
Greetings! May our mighty gods lend wisdom to my speech, and patience to your hearing!
You are most worthy for listening to my words, spoken in hope, for my people.
I bring the blessings of my gods and my people. All look favourably upon you today.
May the gods bless your patience and give me words that will gain your agreement.
You honour me with your attention. I hope my words will be heard with kindness.
I am thankful that I have your ear, and hope that I can speak the right words to please you.
I have been chosen by my people as a tongue for their words. Hear me, then, with honesty…
Greetings and blessings of my ancestors! I have much to say, if you will but listen…
I am sent to speak to you, and hear words. I must have offended many gods to be given this reward!
I come to speak. Bah! How many of the gods did I offend to be given this weakling's work\?
I’m am here with all the enthusiasm of a lame horse, buckling under unfair burden. Hear my words…
I would sooner be filling my belly with good pork than bandying words! But speak I must!
I am looking forward to a bellyful of ale once we are done, so I will speak plainly and quickly.
I am cursed because I must speak with you. Do not, then, make me waste breath.
I would sooner face demons, harridans and harpies than deal with you, but such is my fate.
Few among my people envy me today. And having smelled you, I begin to understand why…
I am not known for a patient or kindly nature, so listen as I speak. And then agree!
I like an axe or sword better than weak words, so you would do well to agree today!
I come to give of my word-hoard. Will you listen as I speak for my people and my gods\?
In the name of our people, greetings! I have words. And if the gods will it they are words of friendship.
I greet you! May the gods of fellowship bless our meeting.
I hope I am welcome here, and that my words find willing ears and wise hearts.
The greetings of the gods to you. I carry my people's word-hoard, a gift for you.
I ask only that you listen. I am the messenger for my people, and an honourable son of honoured ancestors.
I bring you word from our elders and wise women, crafted in good faith, and delivered with truthful tongue.
I am to speak of agreements with you, honourably offered and honourably received.
My people are not word wastrels. We speak to the point but, I hope, with honesty.
If you would hear my words, then I speak with the voice of my people.
Our warriors hunger for battle, blood and glory! Shall we attack these feeble fools\?
Our warriors, both proven and young, have a taste for battle. Give us word, and we will attack these people!
We stand ready to give these people fire and sword, pain and death. What say you\?
Can you not attack these folk\? Your bravery in this would surely be worthy of a bard's song!
I call now for you to take to arms against these human wolves. Give your warriors leave to fight!
Are you honest warriors, who will come to a brother's aid\? Will you send your spears against these enemies\?
I ask for my people, not myself. What help can you send\? Such is our plight that I will… beg... like a woman…
Our foes circle like wolves. My people fear, and I must beg help from you, our sworn friends.
Our defences are weak, and our old folk know fear. Can you send men to help against the foe\?
The hills and valleys weep at your tread. The trees and streams are unquiet. Please: your soldiers must leave our lands. Now.
My lord has talked to his wise woman. The crops may fail because your men dishonour our gods! They must leave!
My long-dead ancestors are uneasy. Your armies wake them. Can your warriors not go elsewhere\?
In the long ago of the world, our forefathers had a vision that they would rule these lands. Would you deny prophecy\?
I humbly request that we are given these lands. Would you refuse so small a thing\?
Our gods have spoken clearly: these lands are ours, by divine right. Now, will you aid the gods\?
I implore you not to let our peoples be separated. United in greatness, do we not all gain\?
My proud people treasure the blood bond between us. Do you not see this\? Will you join us\?
We choose friends with care, and when all sit at the same hearth are we not closer than brothers\?
I humbly ask that my people's warriors may come and go in your lands, so that they may fall upon our joint enemies!
Our warriors will trouble neither man nor beast in your lands… Your Women\? I cannot promise that…
Will your noble people let us enter your lands\? We seek nothing else from you.
My lord's needs are simple, and could be easily met with payments every so often. To suit you, naturally…
We are not greedy but we could see you as most worthy if you contribute to our treasure-stores.
Gold aplenty is a comfort to anyone. We would think well of you if you were to give some small coins…
Gold, freely given and gratefully accepted, is a blessing from the gods to all involved. So say the bones…
We have simple needs. All we ask is a small amount of wealth. You will hardly notice it…
My people can only dream of wealth like yours. Can you not spare some for us\?
My people are in danger! Can you not join with us and attack these dogs\?
The skill of your generals is famous! Can you send them against these people, who blight our lives\?
These people trouble even the gods! I beg you: march against them before it is too late!
Why keep a treaty with these hateful wretches\? They are a byword for evil and deceit!
Do not waste friendship on these ungrateful dogs, I beg you! These creatures will turn on you!
Do not remain tied to these wicked folk. Your people are better than that, as you must surely know!
Join your mighty strength with ours in this struggle. I ask for my people's sake.
Your men will turn the enemies' bowels to water! Come, aid us in this war, I beg!
You are strong and wise, and yet I wonder why you stand aside from this war. I beg you: fight!
The gods have decreed that we must walk alone. The alliance is ended.
Blood and honour has bound us in friendship but now, in honesty, we must walk towards our own fates.
Treaties have served us both well, but now the ancestors tell us to stand alone. We are done with you.
We have had friendship but now you must find you own feast. Our treaties and agreements are done.
The time has come for bonds to be broken. So speak our gods, and so must it be.
You have been worthy allies, but our unquiet ancestors tell us to put aside friendship. This we will do.
For many seasons your warriors have walked in our lands. Now the spirits are restless. Walk there no more.
Our lands are closed to you. March no more in our hunting grounds or fields. I have spoken.
Your men are outlanders, and the spirits have become disturbed. Your armies must no longer march in our lands.
My lord has ordered that your merchants must leave, and our traders return from your lands. It will be done.
My people no longer want your goods. They displease them, and our gods. Trade is done.
Our wise women have looked into the flame, and see no good coming from trade with you.
Our word-trade is now ended, and I will accept your proposal. Come! To the ale!
Excellent! We have agreement. Your mouth talks well. Let us see if your belly can hold ale!
We have talked long to reach agreement. Now we must drown ourselves in ale! Ha!
Now, we have talked long, but we have agreement. I am content with the day.
The spirits have guided us to common sense and agreement. Now, some ale to guide our wits to sleep!
You speak well, but can you drink and feast as cleverly to seal our bargain\? We shall see!
An end to over-long talk! Your offer is not what I want to hear! My throat yearns for ale, my ears for silence!
Your speech holds much that is good for your people hidden in many words, but less for mine. I say no.
The gods forbid me to say yes, for we have talked too much and said little.
My belly grumbles for swine and ale. We must talk no more. The day is done.
I looked for agreement worthy of ale and song. And I have been saddened not to find it.
I find but scant meat stuck to your boney words. We have nothing more to talk about!
Friend, you have fearsome foes. Will you send away our warriors if they come to help\?
We could lend sword and spear to your cause. Say but one word, and we will come!
We need the glory of battle! Let us stand with you against these darkling foes!
When do you attack these people\? It is a simple warrior's question, and needs no great thought before an answer!
You stand idle while these cattle ticks burrow deep! Do you lack the courage for war\?
How long can you stand aside and let these rats run free\? When will you stamp on them\?
We do not beg, we do not ask. We expect your help against these people. That is the price of brotherhood!
When storm clouds gather, we look for shelter and help. It is time for you to be helpful…
The gods test us with war! Now, take up the spear and come to our defence!
Our lands are closed to you. Your warriors must go. So speak the spirits and our ancestors.
Our patience with your errant warriors is done. They are no longer welcome in our lands.
We grow tired of the cursing your armies in our lands. We want rid of these thieves!
You do not need these lands. Our people need these lands. Be reasonable, friend, and give them to us.
The gods gave use these lands. Hand them over, so that they can be properly ruled.
These lands will be ours. Hand them over, or our people's resentment may be too strong to control.
Join with us. It is right and proper, and the spirits of our ancestors long gone will be pleased.
We are bonded by blood, honour and war. It is the will of the gods that you unite with us.
Are you fools\? Will you hold back when you can be a part of what is decreed by the gods\?
Our warriors will come and go as they please. Be wise, and stand aside at your border.
Our warriors will pass through your lands. Be wise, and leave the door ajar…
Our warriors have no quarrel with you, and honour your courage, but they must march where they will…
Blood calls out to blood, and kin to kin. Be wise, and let us come together as one people for the good of all!
We are children of the same gods! What sense is there in denying that we are one family\?
The wolves run in the dark all around. You need the protection of your brothers, don't you\?
The wise woman has spoken: You have no chance to survive make your time. Be wise! Accept your new masters!
My people are wise and worthy masters. Be wise, and take the expected oaths. You can still prosper.
Your freedom means less than nothing when you die in fear. Give it up, and live, with new masters…
We are not merchants, but we understand gold. We understand that it turns aside many swords.
Opulence is for the greedy, yet we still have use for gold. Indeed, we could use your gold…
Is it the act of a brother to keep such wealth as yours entirely to yourselves\?
Our warriors thirst for your blood and hunger for your women. Perhaps they can be distracted by gold…
The love of gold can stir evil in men. Give us your gold. Avoid the evil it brings…
While the spirits of our ancestors have no use for gold, they do know that their living children think differently…
It is time to talk, like men, of many things. We can put aside swords for the time it takes to speak a word or two.
I set aside my sword, to speak to you, warrior to warrior. This is the way of the world, for men.
I offer this in the name of our people. Let this be a sign of goodwill to come.
Our offer is fair and honourable. By the gods, all will be as we agree here!
Consult your ancestors, but you will see the merit in the offer I bring from my people.
I speak as the sword cuts: directly to the bone of the matter. Listen, and possibly give agreement.
I am not here to burden you with demands. My offer is what we consider worthy of your people.
We do not have the civilized graces but we offer our words honestly, from the heart.
It is the nature of warriors to cut to the heart of anything. Consider this proposal carefully.
I do not hold with overlong talk, preferring the axe's edge as an argument. So listen, and then agree…
No, no, no. The gods would set a red plague upon us all if I agreed to such a thing.
My people cannot accept such an thing. The gods would rightly curse us!
My people deserve better of you than these words. Are we not warriors and men\?
I cannot take such an arrangement to my people, it would betray their faith in me to accept this.
There is no joy in this. I see no gain in these terms for my people.
This is not pleasing. My people deserve more from me.
This is not enough. I cannot take these terms before my people. You must do better.
The gods will not allow this. For all its merits, it is not enough to calm them.
To accept these terms would risk the wrath of my gods and my people. I cannot act on this.
I fear we must talk further. I am yet to hear words that meet with the needs of my people.
Bah! In another place my sword would take your head or manhood for such words!
No, no, by the gods, no! One day your empty skull will find better use as a drinking cup!
Did your mother whelp any sensible brats\? Still your flapping tongue, or my knife will find good use!
One more proposal like that and I will have you thrown, bound hand and foot, to starving pigs.
The gods give me strength! No! O! How I long to strangle you with your own stinking guts!
So, you pour fine, civilized wine for yourselves, and a cup of piss for us. No, you fart-spawn.
I say No, but you speak well. I hope you soon speak with your mewling ancestors.
A piss on your offer! And a piss on your slave-born ancestors too!
Did the fey folk take my wits\? Do I suck at the teat of madness\? No\? Are you sure\?
Your gods gave you bravery. I will give your manhood to my dogs after any more such witty offerings!
You speak well but I fear the spirits do not approve. I cannot go against such portents.
Our gods whisper to me that I must reject your offer, worthy though it was, and hope for something more.
Your people are a byword for honour, but I cannot quite accept the terms that you offer.
You speak from deep wisdom although the offer is but shallow. I cannot agree.
I fear our ancestors' unhappiness if I accepted, generous as your offer seems.
I cannot agree, even though the ale calls and the food smells most excellent.
I cannot settle on such terms. Your people are worthy, but my people deserve better of our talk.
The gods would be displeased if I said yes too easily, although you speak your part well.
You have an honest tongue, and so I reject your offer hesitantly, and without wishing offence.
You speak as well as a bard, but I must be unswayed by all except the interest of my people.
Endless chit-chat is burdensome and womanly! Your words fill my ears and offer little of worth!
Drink, for the love of the gods, and stop talking for a moment! Your words make my skull throb and burn!
This talk has kept me from a warm woman and good ale! Your words weary my ears.
Enough, enough! My head buzzes with words, like too many angry bees! I need good ale to wash them away!
We have talked until the gods themselves have fallen asleep. And to no purpose. We are finished.
You lay siege to my head with your words! I am done with talk! Bring me ale, and good pork!
You are honourable, worthy and strong, and only fools would not wish to be friends with you.
As clouds gather, wise men look for friends to shelter them. In you, I believe we have such friends.
Our ancestors have spoken, and they have named you as true friends. Do we dare ignore the otherworld\?
No warrior likes standing alone in battle. Should we not be sword-brothers, and watch for each other\?
Darkness gathers, but you can be the light for my people. I ask, humbly, for a treaty…
The gods speak through thunder and storm, but they tell us to ally with you, if you will have us…
Our gods despair of this bloodshed! We plead for an end to the wars between our peoples.
We suffer a tormented marriage but a bond can be found. My people appeal for a settlement that will end the hostility.
Only the dark gods celebrate this war and its suffering. I ask you to think of this, and give us peace.
You are a worthy foe indeed, but now the killing must end. Will you not give us peace\?
Many warriors have gone to the afterlife. Even the bloodiest of gods no longer thirst. It is time for peace.
Too much that was good and honourable has been lost. I beg now for my people: give me peace.
We do not beg for gold, only ask that we can have trade between us.
Words can be all that is between people, but we would like trade as well, if you agree it…
The needs of my people are simple: some of your fine trading goods in exchange for our wares. Well\?
I like friends. I like making friends. We could be friends. Then I wouldn't have to kill you. Just enemies.
We want you as friends of our people. So will you accept the hand of friendship, or turn away\?
Will you be counted as friends, or will you walk you’re the crow road into a dark future\?
We could stand, like brothers, with shields overlapped in the wall, our blades in hand, and defy the world!
I ask you, doing you proper honour, as befits a warrior folk, to be our allies. Come now, be brave!
Carrion birds gather. Swords are being sharpened. This is not the time to stand alone. Come, be allies!
There is a time when warriors must sheathe the sword, and talk, for the good of their people.
Only the greatest dare speak of peace to their enemies. Only the weak seek the death of all.
The sword was drawn, but now it is blooded. End this feud. We offer peace today, or the sword tomorrow.
We come to you in strength, to speak words of strength. Reply, then, with the strength that welcomes peace.
Shall we hack at each other, until our enemies can gorge themselves on warriors' flesh\? Or will it be peace\?
Our struggle will end badly, and with little honour for anyone. My elders suggest peace. What say you\?
My lord's offer is simple: trade. You have much that we want. So, what say you\?
Set aside thoughts of war for now. Trade is what concerns me today. Traders can bring prosperity to all!
My offer is a straight-shot arrow. My people want your trade goods, trinkets and the like. What say you\?
My people have little need for these lands. We offer them to you.
These lands and people are, the elders have decided, not worthy of us. Do you want them\?
These lands are yours, if you wish. We would be rid of them-- aye, and every bastard dwelling there.
I do not think this is a good idea, but... we will offer you gold, much gold.
We have gold to share with you, worthy warriors. Spoils of our battles, if you like…
I am not always thought generous among my people, and do not easily give coin away.
We can agree here, if the spirits wish it, to proper treaties between our peoples.
My ancestors have spoken well of you, and so we offer a treaty. The worthy make the best friends.
The shield-wall is always stronger when brothers stand together. That is why I offer a treaty.
This is a time for just proud men to unite in strength. That is why I propose this…
The hungry dogs are all around. The wise man bars his door and looks for shield-brothers. What say you\?
I have talked to the wise women and all speak of a treaty. And our elders see greatness in you…
I have been to the circle of trees, and listened to the spirits. They speak of nothing but peace…
Strength and bravery have been shown by the living and the dead. Now it is time to set aside war…
Our rivals circle like carrion crows, and we fight on to give them meat. We should have peace.
Our gods are old, bloody and demanding, but even they think this war is wasteful. Shall we have peace\?
How much blood must we spill before we find wisdom and end this struggle\?
Do we fight until both of us are on our knees\? Our peoples deserve more! They deserve peace!
A river of goods and coin between our lands would surely see all prosper. Will you agree to trade\?
All would surely benefit if we agreed to open trade from this day on. Well\?
We have fine goods and you doubtless have much that we would find desirable. So, are we to have trade\?
I offer this morsel. Now, like a wolf at the door, perhaps you will go find better hunting somewhere else.
The spirits tell us that we should offer you gold. We do not argue with the spirits.
My people wish to offer you this gift of gold, if you will take it.
Sit, friend, and let us talk. And let us have good wine until we can talk no more!
Greetings, friend! I have called for good ale to ease your throat, and-- ha! Ripe women to ease other parts!
Welcome, worthy friend! Let us break bread and drink ale before words pass our lips!
You honour us! There is food enough for two armies awaiting us when we have talked!
Welcome! We will talk, and then we will feast until our guts rumble and our backsides ache from overuse!
My friend! Be welcome! The spirits of this place smile upon you, the gods bless you.
Good and noble friend! What an honour you do us! Come, speak so that the spirits can hear your words!
There is good pork roasting for you, and better ale and mead set aside, but first, we talk!
I look forward to your wisdom, but I trust you will not object to a cup of wine first\?
We have need of talk, I am sure. But we also need good food, a warm fire and warmer women!
Speak quickly and well. Speak ill or slowly and I may feed your tongue to the dogs.
Gods of the afterlife… spare my arse! Well, why do you trouble my digestion today\?
Are you brave or foolish\? Or just mad\? Well speak, I will listen before I turn you inside out!
I have little to gain in wasting the day on you. What you say had better please my ears!
I am sure you have many pleasantries for me but, please, don't bother. Talk of meat, not honey.
Welcome. Speak. Come on. Do not waste time better spent at hunting.
My time is better spent feasting and hunting than listening. So be quick with your chattering.
You have the ear of my people. Do not waste words. We are worthy of better.
Come, come, let me hear your talk. I warn you I have no stomach for the meek or nice.
Do not attempt to sweeten truth with honey. Speak plainly, and I will deal honestly. Flatter, and you fail…
Greetings. Now, speak plainly, for we are an honest folk and value honesty in others.
Well met, friend! Sit, and let your words move me to anger or agreement, as you wish of them!
You are welcome, although my ancestors and people expect talk with purpose and honesty.
We will gladly listen to your offers, but do not to wrap them in lies. The spirits know truth.
A flapping tongue that speaks without wisdom is not welcome. Be like a spear, and have a point! Ha!
Greetings, speak plainly and without idle purpose and all will be well. The sure thrust strikes home, after all.
Greetings, friend. We will speak together of whatever you wish, but bring words that can warm our hearts.
I welcome you, worthy speaker. I listen because your people are known to have honour.
The gods will have me listen to you, but do not pass the day in words without merit.
Greetings to you! I trust you come with honourable words that I can hear kindly.
Why\? Why would warriors who value honour do such a thing to people who are no real threat, as far as we can see\?
It is true, we glory in battle but we are not murderers in the dark. Find other tame killers...
We are not a club in your hands to bludgeon your enemies. If they offend you, kill them yourselves!
So… We fight your enemies while you hide, grow fat, and whore yourselves stupid. An excellent plan! Bah!
My people are not your shield. Are you so sunk in cowardice\? You are geldings indeed, then!
You have the courage to ask this, yet cannot pick a sword to defend yourselves properly\? Great gods!
Us\? We should serve you\? As your tethered goats\? Your dogs\? Your slaves\? Your head injury goes unhealed, then!
I say my defiance is as sharp as a sword, as true as the arrow, as strong as a stallion!
My people bow to man, least of all the snivelling, shit-biting weaklings that pass as your rulers!
I will not hand over our people to your keeping. I would die of shame, and wander behind the winds, unlamented and cursed!
Such grovelling would bring the fury of the gods upon us. And we would deserve their anger. As do you.
Only a goat eats everything within reach! You were birthed by a goat! You smell like one as well!
The gods and our ancestors long dead would strangle us in the night if we allowed such a stupidity!
Our lands would never be rid of the stench. You may not march in them.
Your armies are not fit to march where our gods still live. You pollute their peace by even asking!
Gold\? Is that all you value\? You shall have none from us, only rich contempt!
We do not pay wolves to keep them from our flocks. When we can be bothered, we hunt them.
Spare you some gold\? You have so little honour, then, that you beg at table for scraps. Away, cur!
The only gold I will give you is the piss from my slaves, and I begrudge you even that!
The feeble and weak-willed may throw you meat, but we do not hold with feeding stray dogs.
You think me a fool then\? Or my people\? Or our ancestors\? One coin, and your begging would never end!
A fancy word for slavery! Keep your whips and chains for your own household, or your wife.
We do not bow before foreign dogs. I would sooner throw my family into the flames than do such a thing!
You folk, our masters\? Truly, the moonbeams have been busy in your head, fool! Away, back to the other madmen!
Do not ask such a thing! The gods are quick to anger, and will demand blood!
These lands can never be yours! The spirits here would tear you to pieces rather than see the people submit!
You\? Rule these...\? It is true then. Madness runs in your people. But... you don't foam at the mouth…
What\? Such wit will one day surely cost you your head! Let me take it now, and save you trouble!
Do I look like some civilized city whore\? Do I\? Well, why do you try to use me like one\?
Ally with gutless wonders such as you\? My people deserve better. You deserve a spear point for the idea.
We do not need to cower behind your shield, for we are warriors not weaklings. Look to your own defences!
What do we gain from this\? Friends\? No. Feeble-minded fools unable to mate with goats without mucking it up!
You pitiful wretches have a sense of humour. I would as soon ally with week-dead fish. Their stink is better!
Peace\? Peace\? I laugh at your peace! We do not make peace with fish-faced fools!
Peace is not to our taste. The sword is different! And ale! And the screams of your women! Not peace!
Peace\? Be grateful I do not have your peaceful tongue ripped from your head for speaking such a word!
My ancestors were quite… inventive with dolts like you. They used fire, and skinning knives. Peace\? I spit on you.
What\? Peace\? When your skulls are as yet unstacked, and your women have yet to kill themselves in despair\?
I cannot stomach your cowardice. Your people will have peace. When they are all stacked on the funeral pyres!
Trade\? Do you think us children, flattered and distracted by your pretty beads\? Bah!
Your coins have your ugly-faced rulers on them. None of my people want them in their purses.
You think to turn our heads with your unholy trinkets\? Save them for the little boys you favour…
So, you think we will sell ourselves, like your women\? You are truly mad, then, or stupid!
Keep your money. You will need it to pay your way to the afterlife. And it is tainted anyway…
It takes more than your stolen gold to win our favour. Give it to your remarkably foul gods!
Be grateful that you are not eating this mighty treasure, piece by piece, with boiled leeks. You insult honour!
Your money may win favour among whores but we will not be used for your filthy pleasure.
Our warriors are needed elsewhere, and even the sharpest sword cannot be thrust into two enemies at once.
The spirits tell us that our warriors cannot be wasted on these dogs. You must tame them without us.
The wise have spoken. There is glory in it what you ask, but our path goes a different way.
The plan is good, but we cannot send warriors to help in defence. Our wise women have spoken against it.
I will not be a mouth-friend, to promise much and give little. We cannot help. You must stand without us.
My people cannot move at every wolf howl. We wait to see what the pack is doing.
Our gods would weep, and rightly, to see us give up our freedom and become your dogs.
I will not offer up my people as sacrifices to your glory. Ancestors! Strike me down if I ever do!
I will never as my people to bow to you. Never. Our hard-won freedom remains ours!
We value our freedom, my friend. We cannot set it aside and no longer be counted free men!
My people still have the strength to stand alone, and the stubbornness to reject such an offer.
We are set in our ways, for they served us and our ancestors well. We cannot join with you.
Our gods taught us some wisdom.  Armies can quickly turn to conquerors once they are inside the gates.
No. The ancestors would sleep poorly if your men were tramping across our lands.
The wise man closes his hall doors in winter, and keeps out the fierce winds that blow.
I had not realised that your people were reduced to begging for scraps at others' doors.
Ah, friend, by the spirits this is sorrowful. I was about to ask you the same thing!
Your war-chest may be empty, but you look to the wrong men if you hope to fill it.
Ha! Away with your foolishness, before you feel a golden boot at your arse, emissary or no!
The spirits would not let me rest easily if I gave you money and, in the doing, took honour.
Where have you put your people's pride\? Is it eaten by wolves, or pecked away by carrion birds\? Gold\? No.
No! I would not give over even the meanest of our people to your considerate mastery.
My ancestors roil in their sleep! That such an offer is made... I must reject your demand.
Where is worth in this\? You gain rebellion, dissent and bitterness within your walls. We gain nothing.
I think not. Blood and treasure brought us those lands, and we value them.
No, no, no. The spirits of those lands would be unhappy if we left. We have a duty to them.
We hold what we have grasped. The sword and shield can only be taken from our cold, dead hands.
A man is judged by his friends. This is not the time for such an agreement.
I cannot say Yes and be anything but a mouth-friend. That sits ill with me, so I say No.
Your offer was kindly, but we have no need to share glory, ale or good pork with you.
I thank you for the offer, but we are not wet nurses for weaklings.
Our ancestors were proud men, and stood alone against the world. For now, can we do any less\?
The man who hangs upon the shield of another is nothing but a burden.
Ah, you joke, even in this! I admire your people for their sense of humour!
You are a funny little man. And we do listen to what funny little men want.
Silence has not yet fallen. It is not the season for peace.
I expected such an offer, but not so soon. My people still enjoy the taste of glory…
This is not a time of peace. When the trees sleep, when the moon has waxed and waned, then, maybe…
Our gods do not want peace. Our gods want blood! And honour! And sacrifice! We do what the gods ask…
I do not think our people want your trinkets. They like honest, manly stuff for the most part.
I am sure that your wares will find a home somewhere, but not with us…
Your goods... well, no.  We see little gain in trade between our peoples.
I am sure that money means a great deal to you. But we value honour, and honesty, and glory!
Our ancestors were never beggars or servants. And we will not become your paid hirelings.
We are not farmhands or hired killers, to be given a little bread in exchange for obedience.
You have the heart of a merchant, my friend. A merchant. We do not want your gold.
A tidy sum, to be sure, but our hearts are full of courage, not lust for gold.
Our ancestors would be shamed if even one of your coins was accepted. They were proud, our ancestors…
Our ancestors are restless! Please, get your soldiers off our lands or suffer the endless curses of our honoured dead!
Your armies must go. One. Two. Three. Four... Five… Have your warriors left our lands yet\? Six… Seven…
Your armies must leave our lands. The stench alone causes sows to miscarry, and all our sheep look nervous!
We do not ask it lightly, but the gods favour it: an attack on these people would aid our cause!
You have been blessed with courage, so will you not use that courage to help us\? Attack these people!
Can you spare men to cut a few throats\? These people need death. They would welcome it at your hands…
I speak now of our need for more warriors, to defend against these people. What aid can you send\?
Dogs circle us and bare their teeth. We need a friend or two to watch our backs…
Will you send aid\? A wise man looks to his brother to bring a bucket when the floods come!
Our gods grow weary of your soldiers' tread! As you value friendship, remove your men from our lands.
Your warriors can march in our lands no longer. The spirits have spoken clearly on this matter.
We have been quiet for a long time, but now it is time for your warriors to go home.
My people would take it as a great kindness if you gave us these lands. And kindnesses are always remembered.
These lands have worth for my people. Please, let us make something of them and we will all surely prosper.
Please, hand over these lands to our care. The trees and spirits would have it so.
War makes strange demands on friendship: let our warriors pass through your lands, if you will, for friendship's sake.
The winds blow leaves where the spirits wish them sent. Will you let our warriors pass, like the leaves\?
Our warriors tread many paths, but they do not wish to trample your honour. May they enter your lands\?
Join with your brothers and be the stronger! When all follow one banner, the sky will shake at our approach!
The time has come to join with us, to form a permanent bond that goes beyond friendship.
Come now, let our peoples be united! Together we can find glory unmatched by any rival!
Our people go hungry, and you have much. Would it not be the act of a brother to share with another fallen on hard times\?
I make a simple request, and with respect: can you not spare some gold for my people\?
My ancestors were practical men when they lived. For good reasons, then, I ask you for some gold.
Will you not give our people a little gold\? You have much, and our people do not wish to become the slaves of envy!
The spirits have noticed that our treasure stores are wanting. Can you help with this small matter\?
A token, perhaps a modest gift of coin, would have my people see you in a new light…
You are known as people of wealth and worth. A small gift would make you generous as well!
I ask a small thing: that you give my people a gift, a token, of friendship.
You enjoy a fine reputation among my people already, but a gift would make your worth clear even to doubters!
Stop! Stop! Even the gods grow weary listening to your bleating! Let me have ale now, not shrewish chit-chat!
Even your God of Gossiping Women must have grown weary listening to your endless drone! Stop!
Your mind is awash with word-ale! You have said much, and nothing at all. Enough, then…
Our talk has gone from door to hearth and back again, and without result. It is time to stop.
Your talk has wandered along too many paths. I am lost, and ready to go home! No more talk today!
Ah! War! Good! Sword-bite, shield-crash and your screams on the morning air!
We will walk the warriors' road together then. At its end stands your funeral pyre. I will bring the torch!
War! A man's calling is war, not weakling's gossip! Give me the clash of swords, not wagging tongues!
War! We will make your homes a wasteland, despoil your women, enslave your children and desecrate your ancestor's graves!
Fear is your lot! Now come the ravens, beaks agape for your guts, eager for our sword-work!
Enjoy this quiet time. It ends now. The storm is coming, a storm of blood to wash you away!
You fear us. It is in your eyes, in your stench. And you are right to fear. War comes.
We live for battle, we dream of it, we relish it as others do a fat goose! And you look plump.
War! Our gods demand it. Our ancestors love it. You, I expect to see mewling like a woman!
We will come for you, in the night, and nothing will live. Not one creature. That is our war.

Make Tributary State
If the deal is accepted you will become the tributary state of this faction. It's only worth considering such an offer if in desperately in need of allies.
If the deal is accepted this faction will become your tributary state. Tributary states act as defensive allies, and pay tributes to their overlord each turn.
Ask the other faction to become your tributary state. Tributary states act as defensive allies, and pay tributes to their overlord each turn.
End Tributary State||Do you want to end your tributary state treaty with this faction\?
Join Empire
Ask the other faction to join your empire. If you are strong enough and they accept your offer, their faction will be assimilated into your own. You will control their settlements and possibly some of their armies or fleets also.
Declare War
Declaring war will end any agreements with this faction. This sometimes comes at the cost of deals with other factions, as they will pick sides.
Declare War||Do you want to declare war on this faction\?
Defensive Alliance
Defensive allies are sworn to protect each other if war is declared. It is useful to be on friendly terms with a faction before requesting an alliance.
End Defensive Alliance||Do you want to end your defensive alliance with this faction\?
Military Access
Arrange Marriage
Diplomatic marriage can be used to strengthen ties between two factions. Offering a daughter and asking for a wife both improve relations, although factions are usually reluctant to let go of their own daughters.
Military Access
Military access removes the diplomatic penalty for trespassing on another faction's territory.
Military Alliance
Military allies are sworn to support each other if attacked or attacking another faction. This is the strongest form of treaty. When signed, it replaces a defensive alliance or tributary state status.
End Military Alliance||Do you want to end your military alliance with this faction\?
Non-Aggression Pact
A non-aggression pact slightly improves the relations between factions. It is an ideal first step in building good relations.
End Non-Aggression Pact||Do you want to end your non-aggression pact with this faction\?

Offer or demand payments. Offering payments makes deals more attractive. If you offer payment and ask nothing in return, there will be a diplomatic relations bonus.
Peace Treaty
Peace can sometimes prove more profitable than war. If you are at peace with another faction you may be able to broker a trade agreement with them, or even gain an ally.

Offer or demand to join a war against a third party. Offering to join a war against a hated third party may make a deal more attractive.  However, the more they like the third party, the lower the chance they'll make a deal.
Trade Agreement
After signing a trade agreement a trade route will link your capitals. The more resources you own, the higher the chance this faction will sign the treaty. The predicted income of this trade agreement would be: %n
End Trade Agreement||Do you want to end your trade agreement with this faction\?
Gift Region
You can offer a region to a migrating tribe once they enter your territory. In return, their diplomatic attitude will greatly improve towards you. It's only possible to offer regions where the tribe is present with an army, and only if it's not your capital city.
Create Puppet State
Ask this faction to become your puppet state. If you are strong enough and they accept your offer, they'll gain your protection but lose most of their diplomatic freedom, effectively becoming your puppets.

Truly, my good and noble friend, your kind words and learned debate have smoothed the path to agreement.
I came as a supplicant, and the gods have granted you generosity in abundance! I agree to all!
I agree, and admire your sense and clear thinking in this matter. My people will rejoice!
We had heard of your great wisdom and with this generous offer we have seen its results!
I am humbled by your honourable words. I accept. Come, we have prepared a feast of some splendour!
May the gods bless you many times over! Your wisdom brings much joy to my people!
Do not expect fine words for, while we have agreement here, there is no respect between us.
I am, in truth, uneasy, but the good of my people requires me to put aside such feelings.
There is little profit in this for my people but I will stop haggling.
My lord will not rest easy but I will accept. Perhaps there will be some profit in the day…
By the flame, you offer little, but today I am in a giving mood. We agree.
My appetite for feasting is entirely fled. The taste of acceptance is sour in my mouth.
I accept. When two ride on the same camel they become better friends! Or, ha! They slit each others' throats!
On behalf of my people, I accept. The haggling is done, and we have an end to our talk!
We can ask no more. Your proposal is wise, honourable and, I hope, pregnant with future profit!
I will accept this in my lord’s name, for he trusts my judgement.
We have good reason to accept such terms. My people will give thanks, I am sure.
You present honest terms that I accept and will present to my people.
Ah! So you know how to haggle and when to stop! An offer accepted is a blessing to all!
Your wisdom in this matter is a credit to your people, better than any golden coin!
Ah, my friend, if the wisdom you possess were golden treasure, you could buy the known world!
An excellent decision! Your head masters your passion with wisdom.
Your acceptance is welcome. My people, my master and the gods will all be pleased.
A wise choice. Why lead your people through the mountains when a straight road lies ahead\?
You serve your people with honour and will surely win the favour of your gods.
Your heart and love for your people guide you well today.
You have proven a worthy negotiator. All will rejoice at this outcome.
I had heard that you were as wearisome as a stubborn camel, yet this is not even slightly true!
Such a tribute will be welcomed by my most honourable master.
This is a noble gesture and fitting tribute to the magnificence of my people.
You show generosity. On behalf of my honourable lord, I give you due thanks.
My lord’s protection will offer a shelter from the circling carrion birds.
You are wise to seek shelter in our shadow. My master will guide and protect you.
An honourable choice. You have shelter from the storm for as long as you remain faithful servants.
Very well, our arrangement is over. The winds will blow us as they will, to whatever fate awaits…
The bond between our peoples is broken. Do not look for us as friends in the marketplace.
We are done. Do not look for shade in our tent from the desert heat at noon.
So be it. Look to your own gods for safety. We will look to our swords.
I fear you have chosen a path after too much wine, rather than with good sense…
If this is your wish, so be it. I am puzzled as to how you profit by this ending.
Ah, this is unfortunate, but we will agree. Our armies will no longer enter your domains.
My honourable master will leash in his mighty armies.
We march our armies on other roads from this day on.
The marketplace will grow quiet, and many will weep at this ending, for wealth is dear to all.
If the river dries up, what will the fisherman eat\? Will he still love his lord\?
Our traders will look for new markets. They are adventuresome, and will enjoy the challenge!
Very well. Our soldiers will leave, if that is truly your desire. They were, I thought, helping your ruffians!
Our armies will march away. By my heart, you will be poorer when their magnificence is gone!
You will have your wish. My lord will order the withdrawal immediately.
We have driven too hard a bargain or haggled overlong, it seems. Very well, your decision is made.
I think that many will regret your choice. Let us hope that regrets come singly, not like Roman Legions!
I see that your course is set. Truly, I hope your gods gave you wisdom and not false counsel.
I fear you have turned your people from a path of prosperity and sent them towards misfortune.
Ah! An unwise, even foolish, choice but we respect your… independence… of thought.
I hear and honour your judgement my friend, even if its wisdom escapes me…
Your lack of acceptance is disappointing, but the camel will not hear that roast goat is delicious.
I thought more of you and your people. But your choice is made, and now you must live with it.
I trust that you can face your gods without them visiting you with boils after this…
War it shall be if that is your desire. I hope that you have already paid the mourners!
War, my friend... no! My enemy! War is an expensive business. Be sure you can pay the blood reckoning!
War, my friend, is like wine. Taken in excess it leads to madness and death! I wish you both!
My master will welcome war. He has become bored of mercy, as you will shortly see!
When your lands are awash with your blood you may come to regret foolish notions of glory.
We will blacken the sky with arrows and each will strike a victim through the heart!
May the malevolent gods curse you and blight you! May your swords shatter! May your bows break!
I will save a special arrow, just for you. Look for me on the battlefield.
Any glory you buy with blood will soon tarnish, for you are a people without honour and worth.
I look to more joy from my sword than I ever knew listening to your moaning!
May the gods smile on our meeting, that we may both profit by it!
The blessings of the heavens to you and yours! Kindly give attention to my words, that all may profit!
Greetings, in the name of my lord, and my own humble felicitations besides. May we speak together\?
Greetings  friend! I, as voice for my lord, humbly seek your most noble attention.
I bring terms that I trust will be of keen interest to the ear of one so honourable and wise.
Greetings, most honourable one! I wish for but a short time to explain the needs of my master.
I search not for debate and discord, but for your most worthy attention.
You honour me by your attention, worthy listener! I wish to speak of many matters…
I thank you for receiving me, and for the attention you give to my lord's embassy.
Pleasant greetings to you, worthy representative of a great people! I hope for your fleeting attention…
In the name of my most dread lord, greetings. He sends me to speak in his mighty stead.
Listen, for I speak in the name, and with the authority, of my most majestic and warlike lord!
My most honourable lord and master bids me greet you as befit your station, and to speak in his name.
I bring mighty words from my master, pregnant with god-granted wisdom. Listen carefully, and well!
Greetings to you as befits your position. I speak the words of an honest lord. Listen well!
I bring greetings from my most benevolent lord and will speak to you as long as this does him no disservice.
I have words for the ears of the worthy. For the unworthy, I have only scant regard and less love!
I am not here to debate, dissemble or over-haggle. I come seeking acceptance of proposals made.
I speak only to gain your acceptance of my lord's offerings. You would do well to heed my words.
I am the trusted voice of my lord and demand the attention of an honest audience.
I come as an emissary, bringing greetings and a proposal to our mutual profit.
Greetings! I come to speak for my master, and trust that the gods will breathe wisdom into all who listen!
I am sent by my master to speak on matters of some importance to us both.
I welcome this chance to speak, for I think you will find what I say is of much interest…
Greetings, friend. I bring a treasure of words that will surely find favour with your people.
I seek acceptance for terms that will surely bring progress to all our lands.
I speak the words of a master renowned for honesty and fair dealing. You are worthy of his words.
I thank you for this audience. You should find the words I bring more than interesting.
Well met! I speak, the devoted servant of my people, to one who we would name a friend.
I seek acceptance on certain matters that could result in common gain for our peoples. Shall we begin\?
Do you require help against these scum\? We see much profit in such a course of action.
My warlike people will set upon these jackals without mercy if you send the word!
These are feeble dogs. Say it, and we will have them skinned before the next moon!
I respectfully ask for an attack on these people, as soon as can be arranged..
We ask only a little: turn your mighty fist against this most annoying of foes!
These brazen fools deserve only death. Can your mighty generals take the butcher's blade to them\?
Can you help our defence against these people\? I would offer sacrifice in your name if you can!
We humbly request aid from your glorious armies against this surprisingly determined foe...
These people are hungry jackals. Will you spare even one of your glorious armies to fend them off\?
I must now speak on a painful and humbling subject: your soldiers have violated our lands. Please remove them immediately.
I would not trouble you with this matter, but our gods are offended. Please remove your warriors from our lands.
Our gods and my master are restless while your armies move in our lands. Can you remove them\?
Perhaps, good friend, you will consider that these lands could be more… profitable under my lord's rule\?
Do you, always wise in statecraft, not see the wisdom in surrendering these lands to our control\?
I humbly request that you see fit to give these people to our rule so that all may prosper.
My lord and master asks for his troops to pass through your lands, unhindered and without causing offence.
Our armies seek a route through your lands. They will act with respect and good order.
We have need for our armies to pass through your lands. Will you agree to this humble request\?
Your wealth is famed throughout the world, as is your generosity! Surely my master can benefit from both\?
Your wealth has been long revered by my master and we ask but a small share…
We must bow before you in a humble request for gold, for our coffers empty too readily…
What I ask is such a little thing, an inconsequential thing, that I almost hesitate to mention the amount…
We make this modest request in the knowledge that your coffers strain to contain your wealth…
We humbly ask for a single, modest subsidy to help our people through a dark time…
These beasts slumber, but they could wake to hunt us both. Will you strike while they sleep\?
These insolent fools need silencing. Will your mighty armies march to meet them\?
We implore you: show your strength. Engage these foes and, by so doing, put fear in many hearts…
Why does one so worthy keep a bond to anyone so detestable\? Will you not rid yourself of commitment\?
Your arrangement with these people does you scant credit. Do your gods not mutter of their displeasure\?
My master worries for your souls and your honour, my friend. He cannot sleep while you keep such allies…
My friend, I will plead that you do only this: listen to the gods and join this war!
My master prays that you see opportunity in this conflict, and that you will aid us.
I beg you: consider the glory lost forever if your troops stand aside in this war!
The friendships of nations are not the same as the friendship of men. Nations do not grieve for absent comrades.
I hesitate only because I do not wish to add hurt. But you must now look to your own defence.
By the flame, the bonds between us must be broken. The gods have seen no single path for us.
We can no longer stand with you in peace and war. Such is the way of men.
From this day all treaties are broken, all agreements void, all understandings… misunderstood. So speaks my lord.
Like the caravan of merchants that has crossed a desert, it is time for us to go our separate ways.
I ask that you stop marching in our lands. The gods are offended by foreigners. You know how gods are!
Our lands are closed to your armies. We can no longer offer unhindered passage.
My master decrees that our borders are closed to your troops. I am but his voice in all things.
There is a season when even the river of gold must run dry. That time has come upon us.
Our people have their own luxuries. They want no more trade with the likes of you.
Trade between our lands will now end. Your merchants are as unwelcome as your coin.
Your proposal has merit. Yes, yes… I see much benefit in agreement, and I pray my lord will too!
You have haggled with a clever tongue. My master will be content to settle!
Your ideas are clever and will gain approval from my lord. I guarantee it, my friend.
This is good. The gods will smile on our agreement, and all will be satisfied.
You speak a foreign tongue, and yet you bargain as well as, well, I do! This is most welcome!
Your offer is fair, although I do wonder if you missed your calling. Friend, you should be selling second-hand camels!
Your ideas are undoubtedly golden within your heart and head, but in my ears they are dust.
You speak well for your people, my friend, but your words today have not convinced me.
While your words are spoken in honesty, they offer little to please my master.
I cannot settle on such terms. I would not serve my people to give in to such haggling.
Your cunning would shame a Cappadocian grandmother, haggling over dates! And no, I do not agree.
An acceptance would offend my gods, even as yours giggled about it!
My lord's men stand ready. Do you need aid against these people\? Speak, and it will be yours!
These swinish people will threaten us soon enough, so my lord offers armies to cull the herd…
Your armies stand at risk. We have troops who could help. That is the thrust of my offer here.
My master judges the time is right for an attack on these wretches. Are you ready to carry it out\?
Will you stand idle\? Do these insolent dogs stir nothing in your bellies\? Are you turned into women\?
Will you sit, like old men in the shade, until enemies grasp at your throat\? Or will you be warriors\?
My master expects, no, demands, that you aid our defence. You spoke the words of agreement, now act on them!
We expect loyalty from friends at a time of need. We expect your armies to march to our aid.
It is simple. Move your armies to aid us. Or have the world think you poor friends and weaklings.
My master and our gods are particularly eager to see your troops leave our lands. Immediately!
Your armies have spent too long sheltering from our sun. March them away.
Your men have wet their feet in our rivers for the last time. Remove them from our lands.
My master has no doubts that you will see sense, and hand over these territories immediately.
Prophecy tells of these lands in our hands. Do not stand by and idly defy prophecy!
These people cry out for our just rule. Give these lands over to us.
I am sure you understand that it is in your interests to allow our troops into your territory.
Our armies need a peaceful path through your lands. We expect you will allow this.
My master expects you to allow his armies uneventful passage through your lands. That is all.
Be sensible. Accept the judgement of the gods. Your days of independence are done. Bow before my master!
My lord instructs your people to obey his rule from this day on. Dare you defy this edict\?
Your choice is clear. You can serve my master, alive and with some honour, or die.
For those wise enough to see, there is profit in being generous, and more profit in remaining generous…
A regular tribute of gold to my lord helps his patience. I trust you see a necessity here…
Our own riches are not so grand that they could never be improved by tribute from your people.
My lord expects that you will find it prudent to add a small, almost trifling, sum to his treasury…
We demand only a modest weight of coin. My master always looks kindly on generosity…
A simple tribute is all that is expected and needed. Then all can be fair words between us.
It is time to speak with an eye to mutual profit. I offer this because you are an intelligent man.
I offer this in my lord's name, for he is master of all men, and a ruler without equal!
I speak with honest and honourable tongue. I demand that you listen with equal honesty!
My offer is shaped intricately and with great care. Do not dismiss my words lightly.
Your next move is simple: you take this offer and we both prosper from it!
If you truly serve your gods, you keep a clear mind and think carefully on what I say.
Do not look for an answer to my words at the bottom of a wine cup, friend.
I speak with a simple tongue, without trickery. Accept or do not accept, but do so honestly.
When I hunt, I look for sport. When I speak, I look for honest answers.
We fire this arrow straight and true. It is up to you to snatch it from the air.
Such a thing cannot be countenanced. Our people, not to mention our gods, would forever mutter and be displeased.
I cannot accept such an offer. My lord would rightly wonder whether a camel had kicked me in the head!
I am not a sun-drunk fool, seeking water at any price.
I can give voice to no acceptance. My lord would have my family sold for such insolence.
We are not so bent with the weight of the world that we will bow to this offer.
My friend, I had not noticed my feathers, for surely you think me a carrion bird, to offer such scraps!
This offer is a poor one. Even a beggar in the marketplace would haggle over such a small coin!
I always check the teeth of a camel before I buy it. This beast is definitely good only for soup.
My friend, I had hoped for a belly-stuffing feast. Instead, I am given crumbs from your cheapest dishes…
I will listen further, my good and honest friend, in the hopes you have a proper offer to make.
No, I will never agree! Not even if you were to drag me behind a camel to far Indus!
Ah! You think me a fool blinded by the love of gold, and with sun-addled brains. The answer is No!
I should have your flayed skin nailed back onto your twitching carcass for such insolence! Instead, I will smile, slightly, at your wit…
So, you think me a child then, to make such an offer\? Remember children have nasty tempers, and sharp teeth!
Take care. Fan the flames of my anger and you will enjoy the red-hot pincers of a reply…
There are many holes in the desert, and many problems in those holes, my problematic friend.
I wonder, will you smile at your own wit if we cut off your lips and eyelids\?
There is a man in my entourage who collects... parts of insolent fellows. Do you wish to meet him\?
Mithra's brazen bulls! The gods gave you a fool's face, a fool's wit and an extremely tiny manhood!
I am a civilized man. I promise you civilized and excruciating pain for what you have offered… But not death.
You serve your masters well, but you do not yet make a convincing argument for me.
Your offer is well meant, but it is not as good as I had hoped.
Your speak well, and you offer much, but I cannot give agreement here.
Our haggling must, I think, continue a little longer. Your proposal lacks what I seek.
The gods gave you a clever tongue, but you have not yet used it to say what I need to hear.
Your gods have not, I fear, given you the power of divine persuasion. I cannot agree.
Despite your eloquent advocacy, my good friend, we cannot agree to these terms.
I cannot accept your offer. My head cautions me against your clever words.
I am sure your words carry a cargo of honest intent, but they hold no value for my people.
I have listened long to your witty speeches, but I cannot agree what lies behind that wit.
Enough! My mind is weary with chatter. The wine grows stale, and it was not of the best anyway.
I can listen no more! The day is nearly done. Bring me wine and women, and no more words!
Our words have flopped about like fish out of water, but have given us nothing to gnaw upon.
Gossip and chit-chat are all very well for old women at the well, but I have better things to do!
My lord does not tolerate his servants wasting time in endless talk. We are finished.
By the flame! We have talked but now I lock the gates of my ears to your speech!
We beg for a treaty between our peoples, some arrangement that will give us both prosperity and strength.
Your people are widely admired and I humbly request that you consider us suitable for a treaty.
I propose, or rather ask for, a treaty to combine our forces with your considerable strength.
My lord would have me propose a treaty between us. I will go further, and humbly request such a thing.
Have not omens shown that the gods will welcome a treaty\? Do not offend the gods, I beg you!
I humbly propose this in the hope that you will see the merit of closer ties with our people.
Let there be peace, I beg. Surely now there has been enough bloodshed and misery\?
Do you have enough glory to be merciful\? Can I ask for peace, and hope for its coming\?
My lord accepts that you are a worthy foe, but the time has come to set aside swords.
We have all asked much of our warriors. Now, I beg, let us give them rest.
Our enemies watch with glee while we bleed in the uncaring dust. Shall we spite our foes, and have peace\?
I plead for peace, not from cowardice but from concern. If we fight on, only our rivals profit…
We seek trade and prosperity for all. I am sure that you can see that, in your noble wisdom…
Your merchants are renowned as skilled and honourable traders. They would be made welcome in our markets!
I respectfully ask that you consider opening your markets to our traders, for that way profit flows to all.
I offer this: an alliance against our enemies. Let us crush them into the dust, and see their blood soak the land!
I say this: together we have the might to make all enemies tremble. Consider this well.
My lord offers a treaty against our rivals. He does not make such offers in expectation of refusal.
I say this: if we do not stand, back to back, with sword and shield, jackals will drag us down!
Think very carefully on this offer, and remember that a wise man knows the value of his strongest friends.
I will not demand agreement to a treaty, but I may think aloud about the consequences of refusal…
I will speak the hardest word for a warrior: peace. It is an honourable offer, made to an honourable foe.
We see little profit in further bloodshed. You have fought with honour, but it is time to staunch deep wounds.
I bring word that my lord looks to end the war. He will not look to end it another day.
The storm has raged long enough and now, at your agreement, the softer rains of peace could be yours.
My lord is willing to lay down the sword. It is not often that he is moved to mercy.
My lord offers you a peace. Tomorrow, his pre-occupation with this war may see him unleash further torments.
There is much virtue in wealth and profit for all, as you will surely see after a moment's thought.
Let us trade. You surely will not turn aside from a road paved with gold\?
You should welcome an offer of trade. Your lands will profit much by our merchants' attentions.
I wish to make clear that this offer of lands in no way diminishes my master's power and majesty!
These lands would, I think, flourish under your stewardship. We say  claim them as your own!
These people are not natural subjects to my master. Perhaps they will do better beneath your whips…
If you will allow me a small joke, I trust that your treasurer will not mind counting the money!
Our lands have riches beyond imagining, which is why we can afford to share some of our good fortune.
My master insists that friends be treated well. Your treasury, he notes, lacks gold…
I propose a simple treaty, between equals and friends. All can profit by this offer.
A treaty between our peoples would see us all stronger and richer. Is there need of further embellishment\?
My lord and his chamberlains see much advantage in a treaty. What do you say\?
There is much merit in a treaty between us. So speak the wise at our temples…
We are much alike and so, by the flame, there is much sense to a treaty between us.
A treaty would be an arrow, shot with deadly intent against our mutual enemies…
Camels spit and squabble at each other, but men are not camels. We can have peace.
The arrows of war have missed their targets. Now, perhaps, it is time to talk of peace.
I offer an arrangement that will bring rest to our swords and an end to suffering.
We have all made a desert of men's hopes, and not profited by it. Perhaps it is time for peace.
War has waxed and waned, a bloody moon over our lands. Now it is time for the sun to rise.
We can carry on war's slaughter. Only our rivals will profit by that. Or we can have peace.
Trade is the gateway to prosperity. Will you not pass within\?
Your people, although they do not know it yet, will find our merchandise most wondrous! Why deny them\?
Our merchants are welcomed across all the world for the wealth they bring! Why should your lands be any different\?
I hope that this offer of coins will be taken in the right spirit of comradeship and respect!
Take this subsidy. Our treasuries were over-full!
My lord wishes to bestow coin on your people. Accept it as a token of friendship.
In my lord's name, be welcome, and may the blessings of the gods bring you the profit of the day!
Welcome, friend, welcome! I, in my lord's name, will give you a fair answer before the sun sets!
My friend, you honour this place with your arrival! I, your humble servant in matters of diplomacy, await your words…
My master extends a most magnificent welcome to you and your honourable people. What wisdom do you bring\?
Be welcome! You have my full attention. My ears await your words as willing slaves!
Greetings, most excellent friend! Be at home, and speak as you would before your own hearth-fires.
Please accept as most humble audience for your terms my poor self. Now, speak as you will.
Please, be seated and take wine to cool the head before we heat the day with words!
Greetings, my friend, greetings! I tingle with anticipation of your noble and worthy words!
The pleasures of my household are yours to enjoy. First, though, the necessary burdens of diplomacy…
In time, two things always smell: fish and uninvited guests. Speak quickly, then, before I lose interest, and my breakfast!
Be welcome, emissary, if you come in peace. Be fearful if you come with false words, dripping with honeyed lies.
Am I always to be disturbed by foreigners\? If it is alms you want, talk to my major-domo!
The door is open to you, but if you wish to go beyond the courtyard within, speak!
Do not try my patience with a dull tongue. My torturer has a collection of dullard's parts…
Do not wander in like a desert beggar. If you have something to say, say it like a civilized man!
Before you say anything, know that I have an amulet against the evil eye. Dark sorcery will gain you naught!
I am here, then. Speak your words, and be sure that I find profit in them!
Be welcome, I suppose. Now, speak as you will, and try to be interesting…
You have my attention. Now, do not try to charm, wheedle or cajole. For those, pain is the reward.
Welcome, friend, welcome! Come, sit! Enjoy the pleasures of my home, and let us find accord!
Speak, my friend! Unburden yourself of diplomacy and let us find agreement here, in the fashion of simple, honest men.
I will do you the honour of listening to your terms, hoping to hear wisdom and profit in them.
I greet you as befits your reputation. Now, friend, speak plainly so that we may fall to haggling!
I greet you in my master's feared name. Speak in honesty, and you will be answered likewise.
Greetings, friend. Let us use our time together in wisdom, and seek accord.
I will be a patient audience for your speech, sure that you come to deliver a profitable message.
Come, my friend, speak! We are men of words, and so serve our peoples with honour.
Welcome friend! Let us conclude our business with good haste, and then enjoy the pleasures of this house!
Welcome, honoured emissary. Speak, and I will answer with my master's voice.
Attack these folk\? We bear the burdens while you reap the profits, I think! I refuse this stupidity!
Your notion is as wrong-headed as it is cur-like in delivery! Our armies do not bleed for you.
I will trample your gizzards into the dust before I ask my lord to risk a single warrior!
No, by the flame, no! Not a single sword will be drawn for such a pathetic and unprofitable cause!
You put your head into the lion's mouth by yourself, you fool. We will not stay its bite.
Are you small children, then, to hide behind a grown-up's legs when danger comes\? Bah!
Bow the knee\? To you\? Truly, the gods have plagued you with a dog's foaming madness!
Have your mad gods put fire in your guts at last\? Well, burn! We will never bow to you!
Accept your lash\? Bow to your perversity\? I would as soon eat camel shit for a year and a day!
I will use small words so that you can understand, my foreign friend: Keep. Your. Troops. Out. They cannot enter.
Do not send your hapless armies inside our borders. The stench makes crops rot in the field.
Your men are fine fellows from a distance. Close up, on our lands, they resemble brigands, dogs and lepers!
The only golden thing you may have from us on a regular basis is the fillings of my chamberpot!
Find your own money for catamites, whores and trinkets!
Where then, is your begging bowl\? Are you crippled\? You should play the part to the full, or get nothing…
Ah, the gods blessed you with a fool's face and a sense of fun! Gold\? Now that is for grown-ups…
So, you think us dotards who will pay because we have no memory of services rendered\? Fool!
Thieves do not get the keys to the treasury. They get the gelding knife.
This is a fine joke, and I laugh even as I spit my defiance in your face!
Among your own folk I am sure such idiocy passes for wit! But you are not among your own folk…
Suggest this again, and you will eat your own manhood. Fried, in fat, from your own ample arse!
My master will smile, and have us both skinned, if I do not reject this foolish demand!
In your filthy hands these lands would wither like ill-cut vines. Do not take us for fools!
May your soul be as dust! These people deserve better than to be playthings for your wicked perversities.
Our generals would flay my hide and use it for a drumhead if I shackled them to your walking corpses!
By the flame! I will not cast away all reputation by clambering into bed with a leprous whore!
Mithra's hairy bulls! Your sickening ideas of what is right and proper are beyond my understanding.
You mistake politeness for concern as to your wellbeing. If all your people died, I would merely thank the gods.
You insolence is well attested and demonstrated. Be careful, or I will demonstrate some inventive cruelty!
Your people are lower than camel dung, drying in the desert sun, yet you propose a treaty\? Bah!
You want peace\? Peace\? Now\? Gods give me strength to let this fool live and carry away my refusal!
Peace\? We will have peace, but only when you moonstruck and deformed imbeciles are impaled on stakes! And worse!
Your accent is atrocious! For a moment I thought you were asking for peace! What a fine joke!
You plead for peace. Plead some more. Grovel, even, but above all, know that we do not want it.
Peace. Or war. Is war until you are dead a mature and sensible course\? No, but we want it!
You ask for peace. Ask until the new moon comes, until the world ends, and you will still have war!
Did I hear you correctly\? You want to trade\? No. Our people do not have a craving for dung.
I have heard that merchants give short weight, cannot add coin and lie. Why would we want trade\?
No, and our people will give thanks to the gods for this refusal of your dung-stench rubbish!
Our merchants love gold, our people love gold, my master loves gold. But none of them love your gold!
Your wealth will buy you many slaves to sate your lubricious and disgusting tastes. It will not buy us.
Your gold has a taint about it that cannot be washed off the fingers. We do not want it.
You think to buy us like catamites, like your whores\? You think pride and honour are for sale! Bah!
I am genuinely startled! I did not think your people could count up to such big numbers!
Save your gold. Sooner or later you will need a lavish funeral. I am told wailing mourners are expensive.
A thousand apologies, but such help as we could offer would arrive too late and be of little use.
We can do little against these people. Our wise men have read the flames, and see no good in them.
We cannot. Our armies are but cunning shadows for our defence, not for rash attacks.
Such a scheme is indeed excellent, but we must let you mount a glorious and successful defence!
Our swords are blunted, and our armies in need of drill. We cannot come to your defence.
You must stand alone. Our armies, I find, exist more in the treasurer's accounts than reality…
You undoubtedly think your offer generous but it is only the direst insult, and I reject it.
An offer so pregnant with sincerity is not lightly refused, but this one must be. My master cannot agree.
There is little merit in such an arrangement for my people. I can see the appeal of the idea to you…
I am sorry, my friend, but our gods would be much offended by the presence of your soldiers.
My lord is brave, warlike and enjoys the manly company of soldiers, but not of your soldiers.
Our gates must remain closed and barred, even to your glorious armies.
I think not. Our gold would outshine your other treasures' worth a thousand fold, and you would feel shame.
I am sure your needs are urgent, but my lord cannot give away gold he holds in trust.
We do not give subsidies to passing acquaintances. Perhaps that is why our treasury bulges!
Scant respect would be yours if friendship is purchased! We hold you in much higher regard!
We would find beggars at the gates every day if we gave you money. I fear we must refuse.
Ah, my friend, you ask too much. Gold is happiest with gold it knows, not in a stranger's vaults.
I cannot agree, my friend. Chance may have been unkind, but the gods have yet to finish their game!
This is not a sensible proposition. Perhaps you have a stolen camel you want me to buy instead\?
I had not noticed that the gods had cursed us, and ordered that we were to be your chattel goods.
My master will not hand over one stone, let alone a province because you or anyone else asks politely.
Only the gods could snatch those lands from my master’s iron grip.
These people are loyal servants, and deserve our loyalty in return. You cannot have their lands.
Your arguments have merit, but my lord would not wish me to enter into hasty alliances.
You have a determined tongue but there is no profit in what you suggest.
Friendship does not rely on a form of words, my friend. It is found in deeds.
You show much wisdom in seeking us as friends, but we must rely on our own strength.
A treaty is not to my master's taste today. He is not in an understanding vein.
The merits of a treaty seem to favour you above us. That I cannot accept.
You may well talk of peace! I myself have asked for the moon and stars and a silent mother-in-law!
By the flame, you have a fool's courage! Your peace is a shiny trinket, and finds no buyer here!
The gods blessed you with some good sense. Unfortunately for you, they gave us scant forgiveness.
You dangle peace before us: a pretty trinket. But glory, that magnificent treasure, is within our grasp!
Your plea for mercy is well spoken, but not pleasing to our ears. The war continues.
There has been much blood, it is true. Now you ask for peace. We, however, find profit in blood.
The gods rightly wish us to show humility, and not enrich ourselves at your expense.
Our merchants do not want trade with you. And my master takes note of their undoubted expertise.
Trade with you is, I am sorry to say, all but impossible. Our merchants have business elsewhere.
My friend, our coffers already overflow with wealth from all corners of the world. We need no more!
Your intent here is plain, but to accept your money would put us, ever-so-slightly, in your debt.
My people have riches enough. Your gesture is polite, but not needed.
Your generosity is astounding, remarkable and, sadly, unneeded. My lord cannot be bought like a camel in the market.
Your generous nature does your people credit, but really such a thing is not necessary.
You have an honest face, even as you offer an honest bribe. I must, in all politeness, refuse.
Remove your men from our lands at once, lest our gods are roused and our people, in fear, demand action!
We have tolerated the stink of your armies long enough. Now, remove them from our lands!
The very dust groans beneath the boots of your foul warriors! Get them off our lands!
Are you willing to carry out an attack\? My friend, it is such a little thing that my lord requests!
If you strike the blow will be unexpected and all the stronger for it! Can you not march\?
Come! Profit from this war! Order your generals to march and attack!
Can you not see, my good friend, that defence against these beasts is a necessity\? Will you help\?
We find ourselves facing mountain wolves, and would welcome an extra sword or two in our defence!
You have a chance here to prove that there is no greater loyalty than to friends in need!
My lord has ordered me to remove your soldiers from his land, and therefore I say they must go.
We weary of being good hosts to your armies. Have them march away while we still have some wine!
Your armies do little to calm the nerves of my master. He asks that they be removed.
My lord has ordered me to ask a simple question, with a simple answer: will you hand over these lands\?
Will you give over these lands to my master, so that proper profit can be earned from them\?
There are a thousand reasons why these lands should be ours. Well\?
My friend, my lord wishes to use your lands as a highway, a road to his rightful destination, nothing more…
My master’s armies will soon be at your gates. They merely pass through, hunting other game…
Our armies will march beneath a banner of peace in your lands. It is our rivals who should know fear!
See reason, my friend, and follow a profitable course. My lord is a noble master, and rewards loyalty.
By sword and flame, bow before my master. Start in humility, and all will be well!
My worthy master will be a father to your people, rewarding and chastising as a father.
My friend, there is wisdom in making payments into my lord's coffers. His continued good opinion would be secured!
A regular reminder of friendship, perhaps in gold, would keep you ever in my master's thoughts.
My master likes to think well of his friends. And their gold... Mostly of their gold…
There is much to be said for generosity between friends. It profits both parties, don't you agree\?
I will be honest. I seek coin as token of your good and continued friendship.
My honourable master would have me talk of gold. A lump sum would ensure his good opinion.
Let it be understood that simple tribute honours both you, as giver, and my master.
My master is accustomed to gifts worthy of his magnificence. I hope you have such a gift…
Do you have a grand gift as a fitting expression of friendship\?
Enough! Enough! Speak no more, for my head buzzes like a swarm of bees at your babbling!
Friend, speak no more. You have been a gallant advocate for your people, but you have spoken over-long.
Enough! You haggle like the oldest of old women, forgetting what it is you are trying to buy!
On every path we have taken, we have turned back. I grow weary weary with your indecision.
You give with one hand, and take back with the other. Well, now I use both feet to walk away!
You are bred from awkward stock, a trait common in donkeys, but even less welcome in emissaries!
War it is then! I look forward to it! I relish it! I tingle at the thought of your cities aflame!
We shall put aside words and draw the bow. The arrow will strike where it will, and widows will weep.
By the flame, I will have my lord's torturers prepare special excruciations, O cowardly one! Until our next meeting!
Honourable enemies we will be in war! I trust, my once-friend, your people will fall into darkness and despair!
My unflinching master will burn your cities, your towns, your villages, your dungheaps, until the sky is dark with smoke!
Look to your gods, and pray, for only in them will you now find mercy.
So be it! In all our bellies the flame of war now burns pure and clear!
Return to your people and prepare them for death. That is now your only duty.
Now that words have failed, become an undertaker. That way, you may profit from this war!
Carrion birds and jackals will grow fat on your carcasses, and lose the taste for your rancid flesh!

Your words have a noble honesty about them, and are fair and just. I willingly accept your offer.
Gods be praised! Let them bless your wise words and our agreement today!
I will recommend your worthy proposal to those who can ratify it. We are agreed.
Though our dignity is undoubtedly affronted by this offer, I reluctantly accept.
We embrace this and the virtues of your fine people. This is a day of progress!
Your words are loaded with wisdom and foresight. You will truly be seen in a favourable light.
Though my heart rightly cries out for more, I will do duty and accept your offer.
Agreed, but I do not expect my fellows to find much joy in this outcome.
I do not think I will be much thanked for this acceptance, but such is the lot of diplomats.
Such an offer creates a bitter taste but, on this occasion, we will wince and drink.
There could be more joy in this arrangement, but with honesty, we will keep to it.
The gods hardly smile at such a proposal, but yet we will hold to our words today.
We are in agreement. You will find us an honest friend in this matter.
We are honest men, and will be your honest friends. We have agreement here.
We will surely mark this agreement with games and, possibly, an extra public dole. Ah, the plebians will grow fat…
So be it. We have our agreement and now we must honour the gods and drink to it!
These are terms are suitable and I can agree to them in the voice of the people.
We can settle on terms and I can return to the Senate sure that we have done good work today.
Your acceptance of good, manly, common sense is a worthy thing.
The people will be pleased to hear that their offer has met with your acceptance.
The gods have blessed you in many ways, not least in wisdom beyond your years!
The gods smile at your acceptance. Slaves! Wine to toast our accord!
There has been wisdom at work here. The gods are smiling upon you.
This is a wise and honourable arrangement. You serve your people well through these dealings.
Excellent! The gods have clearly gifted you with wisdom today!
You have chosen wisely, and your people will thank you for many years to come.
And so we have a settlement. I will offer sacrifice for the wisdom we have been blessed with today.
Now, let us to table! I long for a feast and a stuffed dormouse to celebrate our accord!
I am deeply flattered that you would give such a gift to our people. Our thanks.
This is a most fitting and generous gift. We do not forget such generous friends.
We will accept your gift, and give thanks to you and your gods.
It sits ill with us to accept such a state of affairs, but I do so on behalf of my people.
We accept your guidance in all matters, and look forward to future co-operation.
We are a proud people, but also realistic and honest. We accept your command.
So be it. Did not Romulus and Remus go their separate ways\?
Our shield should not lightly be put aside, but I will not say more: you are decided.
All paths diverge when travellers part company. Let us hope you do not fall prey to brigands on your road!
Today, only enemies feel satisfaction at this turn of events in your dealings.
We will end our arrangements. For your sake, let us hope that your gods still favour you.
As you wish, but sometimes folly is only seen as such long after the foolish act.
The mighty Legions will no longer march across your lands.
The Consul will be displeased that the Legions are barred, but your decision is made.
Very well, we will withdraw. I hope your sleep will be untroubled by less friendly visitors!
Your newly impoverished merchants will, I am certain, offer thanks to your gods for what you have done!
We are seldom interested in trade. It is… sordid and unworthy of our nobility.
Our merchants will be displeased to lose coin. But they are used to hardship.
The Legions will leave. Perhaps when neighbours covet your lands you will welcome us again.
We will order Roman armies to leave your lands; the peace should be maintained.
Very well, our men will leave. Let us pray to the gods that they are not replaced by your enemies!
Perhaps your decision is wise and courageous, or foolhardy\? The gods will show us truth when they are ready.
Very well. We will hear your words. Pray that the patricians are in an understanding mood!
Your words are pregnant with sorrow. Let us pray that nothing worse is birthed.
My people may well be saddened by your choice, for we are a society of deep, honest feelings.
There is little wisdom in this ending. Have the gods closed their eyes and turned away\?
Very well. The empty cup is a sad cup, but sometimes no one will pay the tavern bill!
I have been charged to speak in good faith, but sometimes honesty is obviously of little purpose.
I trust you have thought what happens next. We will not be held accountable for your future.
We had accounted you among the wise. I see we were mistaken or, perhaps, overly optimistic.
Very well, the gods will buckle on their armour to defend our honour. Look to your funeral arrangements!
War is the Roman way! We will sacrifice to the gods! Look to your imminent defeat!
You declare war on us\? Ha! Make sacrifice to the gods of the dead, for you will soon meet them!
Very well! There is nothing closer to the true heart of a good Roman than the prospect of war and the spilling of enemy blood!
War is a well-trodden road for Romans. We will not flinch or turn aside.
The Legions will meet this challenge. The men grow bored when they cannot look forward to a battle!
So be it! Put your wives and children to the sword, and save them from slavery at our hands!
The gods have cast their dice, and war it will be. Our honour will be satisfied!
No more talk. Now is the moment for the swords to have the next words.
Very well. Words have been wasted. Time will not be wasted in killing you all.
From the good people of our nation, greetings to our noble friends, and words of great joy to come!
Salutations and friendship from our people, and a proposal for your august consideration!
Honoured greetings unto you. I am sent to speak for the people, for your astute consideration.
Salutations and joyous greetings to you, honoured friend! I have words to speak.
Greetings, good friend, greetings. Let us speak our parts and find agreement!
We graciously extend our greetings and good wishes. Now, to business.
Your people are well known for honesty and manly virtue. That is why I have been sent.
I wish to speak to you of matters of mutual benefit, although in truth, I think you benefit most!
Greetings to you; you are a most worthy diplomat for your people!
I speak with the voice of my people, and am ordered to offer their felicitations at this meeting!
We greet you as to do ourselves no dishonour, yet our words are unworthy for your ears.
The people have charged me to deliver this proposal. I am not envied in this task.
In the name of a greater people, I speak of worthy things to the unworthy.
Hail. Heed now to the words of the wise, and the rightly proud.
I speak now with the dread voice of the people. Listen carefully, for my words have weight!
I bring word from our people to your ears. You would do well to grasp my full meaning.
I come to do such honour as befits your station. So then, greetings.
I will speak shortly as befits this meeting, and come to the business at hand. Greetings to you.
I am but a servant in this matter, and speak only as I must: greetings to you and yours.
I give you such greeting as does us honour, for you seem to have little enough to spare.
Hail! From my people, I send greetings and a proposal.
Salutations! Let us speak as friends, and conclude any business in mutual satisfaction.
Greetings! I come, as an ambassadorial servant, to seek answers to questions of mutual interest.
I am sent to request your attention in some small matters.
Greetings to you and you people. I bring words that may bring joy to your ears.
Hail! The people greet you, and I am sent to speak on their behalf in many matters.
Greetings and respect from my people. They bring you honest words.
I come to offer greetings, terms that may prove agreeable, and honourable pledges if necessary.
I am instructed to speak desirable words to you, that we may come to a satisfactory end.
May our gods bless this meeting, and lend their aid in reaching quick agreement!
Our generals are eager to attack these people. Would this accord with your plans\?
The Consul is minded to deal with these particular people before they become a problem. How say you\?
Our generals stand ready. When would you like us to attack these perfidious foes\?
We would be suitably grateful if you could address an attack on these people. It is a small matter.
These people trouble us greatly. I respectfully ask that you do something…
We have long admired your powerful armies. Can you not commit their efforts to attack these people\?
I request, in the name of our people, that you send aid immediately to defend against these inhuman beasts!
We never forget a favour, freely and generously given, such as military aid against these people.
We have long admired your magnificent armies. Can you not send a few to defend against these people\?
In the name of the Senate and People of Rome, I respectfully request that you remove your warriors from our lands, now.
While your warriors remain on Roman land our Senators are inconvenienced. Remove them and their digestion will surely improve!
While your people and their quaint customs delight many Romans, your armies do not. Please remove them.
These lands are in need of Roman rule. Surely you can see this, and will give them over\?
The Senate are certain that, being wise, you will see that these lands would do very well under Roman rule.
I feel certain that your wise conclusion is that these lands would be better under Roman rule.
We respect strength and wisdom, and I am sure that you will show both by allowing our Legions to march across your lands.
In our people's name I ask, with all due deference to your dignity, that our Legions be allowed to cross your lands.
Your lands and customs would be respected by our Legions, if only you would allow them marching rights.
Though it pains me, I must ask you to make some small payments to secure the people's continued good opinion.
Perhaps I must speak plainly: we require money. There, it is said, and you may, perhaps, pay.
While we greatly admire your people, that admiration would be handsomely improved by a monetary consideration.
Surely, my noble friend, you can see the wisdom in giving a small subsidy to our coffers\?
We find our coffers temporarily empty, and were wondering if you would care to make a contribution…
I dislike begging, but we require money. Surely you can help your good friends\?
Perhaps, in your wisdom, you might find time to attack these people, as long as your plans are not harmed…
Glory could be yours! Take it in open battle against these people! We would stand with you!
I come to ask this: will you stand with us and show courage and honour\? Will you attack\?
Our people wonder why you have a treaty with these creatures\? Break it, and be free of obligation!
We do not understand why you hold to these people. Free yourselves of pointless obligations!
Why do you burden yourself with such unfortunate friendship\? Cast aside these fools, and prosper!
Can you not find the courage to join the war\? The monsters we fight may yet bring doom to you!
We request that you join this war, as honour demands. If not honour, then self-interest should move you!
Your armies would surely find honour and plunder in joining this war! Glory awaits you!
A straight and honest Roman road is not the path you walk. Our alliance is done.
While we have appreciated your support, we must now look to our own defences, and to nothing else.
I am ordered to inform you of endings in some matters, such as our alliance.
Regretfully, we must discount your aid, and look only to our troops in matters of war and peace.
We must follow separate roads. We can be shackled to you no longer.
Our people wish an end to all arrangements with your people. There, it is said openly and honestly.
Our borders are closed to your armies. Our people do not sleep well when foreigners march in their lands.
Your ridiculous marching about in our territory disturbs the people and so must end. Right now.
Your heavy tread has disturbed these lands for the last time.  Your armies may no longer enter our territory.
Our appetite for your trinkets has faded, and so trade between us must end.
It has been decreed that your merchants should not be welcomed into our territory.
Your crude wares no longer suit the refined tastes of our people. Trade between us is done.
God be praised! Let Him bless your wise words and our agreement today!
I will recommend your worthy proposal to the Emperor. We are agreed.
Your words are loaded with wisdom and foresight. The Emperor will truly see you in a favourable light.
I do not think the Emperor will thank me greatly for this acceptance, but such is the lot of diplomats.
The Emperor hardly smiles at such a proposal, but yet we will hold to our words today.
So be it. We have our agreement and now we must honour it!
These are terms are suitable and I can agree to them in place of the Emperor.
We can settle on terms and I can return to the Emperor sure that we have done good work today.
The Emperor will be pleased to hear that his offer has met with your acceptance.
God has blessed you in many ways, not least in wisdom beyond your years!
The Emperor will be pleased at your acceptance. Slaves! Wine to toast our accord!
There has been wisdom at work here. The Lord smiles upon you.
Excellent! Clearly the angels have whispered in your ears today.
And so we have a settlement. I will offer prayers to God for the wisdom he has bestowed on all today.
We will accept your gift, and give thanks to you.
It sits ill with a us to accept such a state of affairs, but I do so on behalf of the Emperor.
The Emperor accepts your guidance in all matters, and looks forward to future co-operation.
We will end our arrangements. For your sake, let us hope that the Lord still favours you.
The Emperor will be displeased that the Legions are barred, but your decision is made.
The Emperor is seldom interested in trade. It is… sordid and unworthy of his nobility.
Very well, our men will leave. Let us pray to the Lord that they are not replaced by your enemies!
Perhaps your decision is wise and courageous, or foolhardy\? God will show us truth when He is ready.
Very well. The Emperor will hear your words. Pray that he is in an understanding mood!
The Emperor may well be saddened by your choice, for he is a man of deep, honest feelings.
There is little wisdom in this ending. Has the Lord closed his eyes and turned away\?
The Emperor charged me to speak in good faith, but sometimes honesty is obviously of little purpose.
The Emperor had accounted you among the wise. I see he was, perhaps, overly optimistic.
Very well, the Emperor will buckle on his armour to defend our honour. Look to your funeral arrangements!
War is the Roman way! The Emperor is certain of your imminent defeat!
You declare war on us\? Ha! Make sacrifice to your false gods, for you will soon meet them!
The die is cast, and war it will be. We will be victorious once more!
From the Emperor, greetings to his noble friends, and words of great joy to come!
Salutations and friendship from the Emperor, and a proposal for your august consideration!
In the name of a noble people, honoured greetings unto you. I am sent to speak for the Emperor on this matter.
The people and their Emperor graciously extend their greetings and good wishes. Now, to business.
The Emperor sends greetings to you, a most worthy diplomat for your people.
I speak with the voice of the Emperor, and am ordered to offer their felicitations at this meeting!
The Emperor send such greetings as do them no dishonour, and words for your unworthy ears.
The Emperor has charged me to deliver this proposal. I am not envied in this task.
In the name of the Emperor, I speak of worthy things to the unworthy.
Hail. Heed now to the words of a Roman Emperor.
I speak now with the dread voice of the Emperor. Listen carefully, for my words have weight!
I am but the Emperor's servant in this matter, and speak only as I must: greetings to you and yours.
I give you such greeting as does the Emperor honour, for you seem to have little enough to spare.
Hail! The Emperor sends greetings and a proposal.
In the Emperor's name, greetings! I come, as an Imperial servant, to seek answers to questions of mutual interest.
I am sent by the Emperor to request your attention in some small matters.
Greetings from the Emperor. I bring words that may bring joy to your ears.
From the Emperor, greetings and respect. From his servant, honest words.
The Emperor desires me to speak his words to you, that we may come to a satisfactory end.
God's blessings upon our meeting, and let him aid us in reaching swift agreement!
The Emperor is minded to deal with these particular people before they become a problem. How say you\?
These people trouble the Emperor greatly. I respectfully ask that you do something…
The Emperor will never forget a favour, freely and generously given, such as military aid against these people.
In the name of the Roman Emperor, I respectfully request that you remove your warriors from our lands, now.
While your warriors remain on Roman land our Emperor is inconvenienced. Remove them and his digestion will surely improve!
The Emperor is certain that, being wise, you will see that these lands would do very well under Roman rule.
In the name of God, I must ask you to make some small payments to secure the Emperor's continued good opinion.
Perhaps I must speak plainly: the Emperor requires your money. There, it is said, and you may, perhaps, pay.
We find our coffers temporarily empty, and the Emperor was wondering if you would care to make a contribution…
The Emperor does not beg, but we require money. Surely you can help your good friends\?
The Emperor wonders why you have a treaty with these creatures\? Break it, and be free of obligation!
The Emperor requests that you join this war, as honour demands. If not honour, then self-interest should move you!
The Emperor orders me tell you of endings in some matters, such as our alliance.
The Emperor wishes an end to all arrangements with your people. There, it is said openly and honestly.
Our borders are closed to your armies. The Emperor does not sleep well when foreigners march in our lands.
The Emperor has decreed that your merchants should not be welcomed into his territory.
Your words are wise, and the Emperor will find much satisfaction in hearing them.
I will give voice to the Emperor's acceptance of your proposal.
I accept! The Emperor, and all his people, will welcome your wisdom.
The Lord is pleased by your words. The people and the Emperor will be satisfied.
So it is done! I almost heard the Emperor murmur with approval at this outcome.
The Emperor would rightly question my moon-struck stupidity if I accepted such a proposal.
The Lord sent me a sign forewarning me of your true intentions! Consider your offer rejected!
I will speak as our noble Emperor would desire and, finding little worth in your words, decline.
The Emperor's will is clear in this matter, and your proposal has little worthy of agreement.
Do you need Imperial help in this matter\? You need only ask, and the Emperor will order it done.
The Emperor feels sure that you will be of one mind with all us, and see that defence here is necessary.
The Emperor instructs me to ask-- no, demand-- that you aid in the defence against these people!
I will speak plainly of the Emperor's wishes: remove your troops. Immediately.
I must be direct: the Emperor can no longer stomach your troops on Roman lands. Remove them!
The Emperor demands that your warriors leave our lands. We have fine roads to the borders: use them!
The Emperor is confident that you will see sense, and hand these lands over for proper and Roman government.
You would be foolish indeed to stand in the path of Rome's Legions.
The Emperor suggests that you wisely open your borders to his Legions.
Come now, see sense. The Emperor insists that his soldiers be allowed to march where they will in your lands.
There is much wisdom in accepting the Emperor as your new master and protector.
Look forward to a life of comfort, justice and peace as a client of a mighty Roman Emperor!
You are overburdened with a large sum that could rightly be lodged in the coffers of the Empire.
While we have no claim to your wealth, perhaps goodwill leads to sharing\? The Lord will surely approve.
I speak as the representative of the august Emperor. You would do well to listen.
I speak for the Emperor. You should carefully consider this offer.
God himself would not make you a better offer, my friend, so think carefully on my words here today.
Come now, the Lord himself would listen carefully to an offer such as this.
Ha! This particular man will keep his virtue and worth, despite your cunning tongue!
No. No. I think that the Emperor's deliberations should not be troubled with your words.
This proposal need not occupy the Emperor's attention. You have said little of worth and I reject your offer.
I do not think the Emperor would countenance such an agreement. Therefore, consider it refused.
Ha! I know the Emperor would laugh at such an offer, therefore I will laugh at it too!
For my part, the omens for this meeting were bad. Such is the will of God, it seems.
The Emperor will correctly regard you as contemptible, unworthy and base because of this childish proposal.
I will not trouble the Emperor with your insolence. My own anger cannot echo but one thousandth part of his wrath!
Great God in Heaven! Grant the Emperor forbearance should he ever hear of this insulting offer!
Why do you speak with mocking tongue\? I would face the lash for even repeating such stupidities to the Emperor.
I could not, in honour, return to the Emperor having accepted such an offer. Therefore, for my part, I reject it.
You are clearly a servant of the Lord, so sweetly do you speak! But we cannot be seduced, even by such a gallant display!
We are a realistic folk, and will accept this accord, even as it hurts our pride.
I accept, and gladly. You have shown good sense here today, and have shown Roman wisdom your thinking!
You don't have a little noble blood, do you, by any chance\? Your proposal here is ripe with intelligence!
O Lord, hear me! I accept, but do not punish my tongue saying what my heart does not feel.
I must serve my people and accept these terms but, by God, we should have more!
The Lord rejoices when men show such good sense! We have an accord here!
I accept. We have an agreement, and I'm sure I have some decent wine around here somewhere…
Excellent, we accept and I give thanks to God for granting us all wisdom!
Now we can drink, and give thanks to God for the wine. We have agreement!
Your proposal has merit for my people and, I am sure, the Lord favours agreeable men.
Excellent news indeed. I shall feast, in modest fashion, on olives and good Roman wine.
We welcome your acceptance. Your wisdom echoes that of God himself!
You serve God and your people well with this agreement. I will make sacrifice in thanks of it.
The Lord will smile on you for this acceptance. You are an ornament to your city… land… people.
By the heavens! You have a good mind in your skull. Your decision here is most excellent.
Your people must think you a philosopher! Your acceptance is most welcome.
You have spoken with clarity of thought and a rhetorical flourish. You have surely earned the favour of the Lord.
A fitting gift and one that any Roman would be honoured to accept.
We thank you. Your generosity will be long remembered by my people.
The Lord will look to our safety. Let us hope you are not visited by the gigantes…
Our soldiers will march elsewhere, although this is not pleasing…
I doubt our people will notice any lack of goods from your lands. Our produce is rather excellent…
A lack of your goods\? Woe! O Lord preserve us! Our womenfolk will be inconsolable! ...Probably.
Our soldiers will march away. By God, I trust that this will not invite enemies to your gates!
I am saddened that the Almighty has not given you wisdom to see the merits of our noble offer.
I wonder what demons were whispering in your ear to make you think this was wisdom…
I spoke with honesty and this refusal is my payment. Such is the will of the Lord.
Your decision does not please us but I hope the Lord, at least, looks upon it kindly.
This is not pleasing to God or man. I had expected more from one considered wise.
War to the end, then. We will laugh as we slit your throats like tethered goats!
Our Lord has surely turned his back on your land! Now you will feel the pain of fire and sword!
War, then... I do not welcome it, but we will not flinch from sending every one of you to Hell!
Heavens above! I am invigorated at the very thought of ridding the world of you people!
Very well, we have war. Start saving your money, for you will need much coin to pay for this folly!
War! Excellent! With so many evil-doers to consign to the flames, Lucifer will be busy for quite some time!
From my people, greetings and their prayers to Jesus for your continued good fortune. Now, to business…
I thank you for your attention. I trust we will find that harmony pleasing to the Lord today.
You are known for wisdom and foresight, blessed by Christ himself. Therefore, give me your kind attention...
Hear my words! I come with proposals so wise that they might have been blessed by God herself.
God grant my words wings, that I may be done with this quickly. I have other business this day.
Hello. HELLO. I. Come. To. Talk. Nod if you can understand me, dolt! O God, give me strength!
I fear my time is wasted but the Lord cares little for my convenience. Very well. Greetings!
I give thanks to God above for the wisdom that allowed this meeting to happen!
The blessings of Jesus on you and yours! I would speak a few words with you, of benefit to all.
The blessings of the Lord be yours and ours today. I ask only for willing ears to hear my speech.
May God give my words swift passage to your hearts and minds, so that we may have agreement!
God give us speed! Lord give us wisdom! And then let us give our people cause for satisfaction!
The signs and portents suggest God himself stands with us against these people. When do you want us to attack\?
Your generals are true soldiers of the good Lord! We ask you today to send them against these wicked people…
We have prayed to God, but also beg your mortal aid! We are endangered, and would welcome defenders!
The Lord shows his disapproval in small ways but, it is clear. Please remove your troops from our lands.
Our gold melts away, like the snows atop the Alps, and we were wondering if you had any to spare…
I beg you: take up arms and attack these people. They menace us all!
Your wisdom is renowned, and surely God himself would see that an attack on these people is necessary.
Philosophy tells us that hypocrisy is a slippery slope to greater evil. For goodness sake, then, break the treaty!
God in Heaven frowns upon discord. But surely false friendship is worse. Break this treaty, I beg you!
Christ weeps when men battle fruitlessly. Can you help us in this war and please the Lord through victory\?
The Lord has given signs that we must bring our friendship to an end. And I am a pious man…
The sun is clouded when your armies march in our lands. God is troubled. Your armies must go.
Your wares are as common as salted fish. We no longer see merit in trade with your merchants.
Your new offer is fair. I swear by the Almighty that, for our part, all will be as we have agreed.
I accept! Let this hard-won accord be a sign from God of more to come.
You have served your people well today. This acceptance has earned you respect and the blessing of Christ!
Ah! I knew we could agree. Let us go and give thanks to Christ, for there is good wine here!
My thanks for your careful deliberations. I go to offer thanks to God, who has blessed us all with wisdom.
Logic has been sorely lacking in our disputations. I cannot agree to this, even though the Lord will be uneasy.
I had hoped that you were a philosopher, and marshalled reason and good argument. I see I was wrong.
An army only stands when all do their part as brothers. Do you need our help against your enemy\?
Lord, spare me from dawdlers! When will you send aid\? We have need of defences against these people.
Why do you think\? This is not a philosophy lesson! You need to help in the defence. Issue the orders!
According to the church, the Lord decreed long ago that these lands were to be ours. Do you defy His will\?
I will speak straight to the spear's point: these lands should be ours. Hand them over. Earn our gratitude.
We have claim to these lands, by ancient blood and by the decree of the Lord God. Well\?
Christ has shown the way for our soldiers. Now, do not defy the Saviour by refusing passage through your lands.
Accept the will of the Lord. We are your masters now, and your people will have their due rewards.
We will be strong and just masters, ruling as wisdom and God dictates. Accept the situation.
Your people have much gold. Ecumenically, this is very bad for them. Put some of the money into our coffers.
The Lord shows his displeasure at our association. He can be calmed with gold, I think.
I offer this now, because the Lord wishes it. I may not make this offer again.
Godspeed your acceptance, for my people have been most generous in offering even this much!
Give careful thought to this offer. My people expect acceptance and, if God helps you, they may have it.
This is what I offer for my people, as blessed by the Lord. Think carefully and be prudent.
Christ inspired us in our wisdom. I suggest that you too should listen to His counsel in this matter.
By Christ, do not take this offer lightly. I make it now in friendship, but that can change…
The word of the Lord influenced our choice of proposal. Therefore, give your consideration appropriate seriousness.
May the Lord give you wise counsel here. They will, I am sure, remind you of many considerations…
By God! You show a rare wit in your proposals, but we cannot possibly agree to them.
Your logic cannot be faulted but, somehow, your arguments lack a convincing flavour. I do not agree.
My people will not agree to such a proposal. It is anathema to them.
No. God has lent you wits and speed in your speech, but was stingy with the truth…
God in Heaven! Send a breeze to rid us of the stench of these words, farted out by an idiot!
The Lord would surely visit us with plagues if I agreed, much as he has done to your poxed people!
You speak with the tongue of a diseased fool. Have you offended the Lord to be cursed in this fashion\?
I am sorry. I gain only the scorn of the Lord God and my people if I agree to your proposal.
God has blessed you with the wisdom to speak well. He has blessed me with the wisdom to say No.
Speak no more! You do not argue your case before God. Being mortal, I need easement!
O God in Heaven above! Rescue me from this torture of words!
As all the angels look down on us they, too, must wonder why we are not firmer allies and friends…
Glory, wealth, and a place in the histories. All of these will be ours when we are united as friends!
I ask, with humility, as the Lord would wish, that you end the suffering of my people, and this war.
God aid my tongue as I make this plea! Can we not have peace\?
I ask for peace. Not for myself, but for my people, and in the hope that the Lord will favour peacemakers.
God would surely bless you if trade between our peoples was allowed. Do not annoy Him.
Come now, agree a treaty and see your enemies quail! Fortune favours the brave, after all!
The omens have been read, and the Lord decrees an alliance. Do not dare defy the Almighty!
God gives both wisdom and strength. I give you peace, if you will dare it.
The Lord loves a trader! Therefore, if you wished to be loved, you will trade with us…
Our Lord has spoken. These lands are not to be ours, but we wish to give them to friends…
The Lord looks favourably on those who do good deeds. Therefore, we offer you these payments…
A treaty between us would please the Lord, and give our enemies much to think about. Well\?
The portents are clear. A treaty between us would please the good Lord, and I have no wish to offend him.
Angels aid my offer of peace, that it may fly from my mouth to your ears with proper haste!
Even the fury of our maker passes, and he looks to rest. Surely we can do the same and have peace\?
Welcome, welcome! In a spirit of good Roman hospitality, I welcome you, and will listen with care.
I am eager to hear your embassy, inspired as it undoubtedly is, by the wisdom of the Lord himself!
The blessings of the Lord upon you! What, then, do your noble people desire of us\?
I give you welcome. Let the Lord God smile upon our meeting, so that all may profit!
God give you wisdom, so that you may speak well, and persuade me of your cause! Be welcome!
May God bless us both with skilful tongues that we may speak our parts well, and so reach agreement!
Greetings, in the name of our Lord. Speak but do not deceive with tricky rhetoric, false logic or cloying pathos!
Be welcome, and may God bless your words with appropriate speed, for I have other business today…
Be welcome. But may God strike us all dumb if we speak anything but truth in our deliberations.
We cannot sacrifice our warriors simply because you lack the courage to do battle!
So, you ask for slaughter… Angels and ministers of Christ defend us! Have you no stomach for a fight\?
The storm clouds do indeed gather. That is your problem. You offended the Lord of Heaven.
What\? Should I offer myself to the barbarian hordes to be used and cast aside\? NO!
Lord give me strength! No! Are you moon-struck, poxed, or suffering from divine disfavour\?
In the name of all that is holy! Truly, the Lord spat you out! And I do not deal with spittle, even divine spittle!
Do you take me for a dull and stupid peasant\? I will not believe any of your wonderful assurances!
Do not even think we are common slaves, destined to labour for unworthy scum!
If Christ is right, somewhere there is good somewhere deep inside of you, isn't there\?
This perverse, impudent proposal mocks dignity, and the Lord! Have you no sense of your place in the world\?
So, you ask for mercy, then. But you have roused anger within us, and divine retribution will follow!
God has blessed us with prosperity. Do not try to buy our favour. We are not graveyard whores!
I fear that you will suffer the wrath of God. Only a fool aids even his friends against Him…
Destiny deals many cruel blows when the Lord turns away. This is just one more of those blows.
The Lord in his wisdom has not yet made us mad, so the answer will be a polite No.
No, I do not think the Lord would approve of us being meek and accepting. And quite rightly.
A well-stuffed purse at the slave market will get you Latin-speaking slaves. And with far less trouble.
God did not give those lands to you. And, while you are worthy, the Lord does not like disobedience.
No. Last night, the earth shook as the Heavens moved. It was a warning of terrible danger…
You want the war to end\? We have drawn our swords, and are not yet ready to sleep.
The Lord, in his wisdom, has decreed that the time of order is not yet upon us.
You took up the chalice. It is a little late now to moan about the taste of poison!
As in all things, the Lord and I are as one: get your armies out of our lands!
In the name of our Emperor I ask for your help against these hungry dogs. When can you send help\?
The Lord did not make our lands beautiful so that you could admire the views! Please, remove your armies!
The Lord gave us those lands. Surely you would not stand in the way of divine generosity\?
Surely, you do not need these lands\? Surely you can see the logic of giving them to us\? No\?
These lands would benefit from the rule of a pious people, a practical people... Well, us, really…
The Lord is a stern general. And at His order, our armies must march in your lands, for a while…
Foul demon, you could not have concocted a more tangled web of nonsense if you tried! Enough!
For the love of God! I have shown patience, but words cannot bounce off your shield forever! We are done.
You speak in barbarous riddles, without good sense in your propositions. Progress is, therefore, impossible!
War! And an end to womanly peace! Most excellent! The Lord favours us above all other races in battle!
From dust we were all created, and to dust you will return. We will see to it as your cities burn…
War against you is not enough, God curse you! May His fury harry your folk thoughout the ages!
I have offered prayers in the hope of a short war, even though I yearn for your suffering!
The Lord asks patience of his servants, but you have tried mine to breaking and beyond. Enough!
The Emperor respectully asks for peace. What good is war\?
Our Legions and your armies have long contended in the field but the Emperor feels that the time for peace has come.
As enemies you have been without equal in courage and honour. Now, however, the Emperor wishes only peace with you.
The Emperor does not offer his protection to any passing stranger, so think carefully on what you say next.
The Emperor, in his wisdom, have decided that your people would make worthy allies. I suggest you grasp this opportunity for co-operation.
Strength can be found in friendship, between men and between peoples. The Emperor feels that we could be better friends.
An offer of peace from the Emperor should not be spurned. Now, what say you\?
Many good men have died in our wars. The Emperor looks for find terms that will bring rest to all our swords.
The Emperor sees no profit in continuing hostility. Let us move towards peace.
Trade prosperity and comforts for both our peoples. The Emperor hopes you agree to such a future.
The Emperor considers that you would be a suitable steward for these lands, if you will accept them.
The august and noble Emperor sees fit to give you these lands to rule as you wish!
The Emperor is minded that you would be worthy to rule these lands.
Our coffers bulge, and the Emperor considers that your people are worthy to gain from the surplus.
The Emperor considers it wise to seek co-operation between us, to the hopeful ruination of our mutual foes. And you\?
The Emperor sees you as worthy allies and suggests that you consider an alliance.
The Emperor suggests that co-operation rather than hostility would serve us both well in the trying days ahead.
The Emperor has seen no gain in further bloodshed and seeks an honourable end to the war between us.
Both our peoples have suffered without gain from this war. The Emperor suggests that it is time to end the killing.
The Emperor is unhappy at our bickering. There is no point in further bloodshed. What say you to peace\?
The Emperor seeks an end to this bitter, profitless conflict. What say on you on terms of peace\?
The Lord God would surely smile on us all if merchants passed between our lands. What say you\?
The Emperor's favour and friendship is rarely expressed in such golden terms.
For the Emperor, be most welcome. Your words will find an attentive audience!
Welcome, welcome, my friend. I will give ear to you, and give tongue to the Emperor's words!
The Lord blesses us with your presence today. I will doubtless find pleasure in your wisdom here.
On behalf of the Emperor, welcome. Speak, friend, and honour us all with wit and wisdom.
Hail! At the Emperor's request I give ear to your just and undoubtedly noble requests!
Greetings in the name of the Emperor, and so forth. Now, what do you want\?
Come then, speak. The Emperor will consider what I hear, but you must speak without delay.
My salutations, and the good wishes of the Emperor, to you and yours! Of what would you speak\?
In the name of the Emperor, welcome. Speak as a friend or as an enemy, but do so with honesty.
I welcome you on behalf of the Emperor, and give ear to your words.
For the Emperor's part, be welcome. I listen and speak for him in our dealings today.
The day's greetings to you. Speak, for you have my attention as the ear of the most august Emperor.
For the Emperor's part, welcome. For my part, welcome also, and give me your wisdom.
God give me patience! The Emperor will never agree to throwing away lives in such a futile way.
We will not use the Legions in such a way. Only the Emperor and the will of God moves our soldiers!
Christ preserve us! You must think us common plebs to ask such a thing!
The Emperor does not require, or want, foreigners-- and desperately in need of a bath, the lot of them-- tramping over his lands.
The Emperor would be more likely to bed the King of the Moon People than to agee your lunacy!
The Emperor's coffers are wisely locked to prevent theft by insolent brigands.
The Emperor would have me thrown from the Tarpeian Rock for even listening to this hare-brained suggestion. And you with me!
I can almost hear the laughter of the Emperor. You have stupidity that would pass for courage to ask such a thing!
You want an end to this\? The Emperor will not be surprised, your weakness of stomach is well known.
You may love a good haggling like women over onions and goats and fish. The Emperor has a vast estate to run!
The Emperor is not a whore and costermonger to be bought for a handful of coin.
The Emperor would order me whipped if I accepted your crude offer!
Such an attack might be prudent, but I do not believe the Emperor will make troops available.
The Emperor sees little need to expend swords and coin from the state's purse on ill-judged adventures.
I do not think that the Emperor would approve of his troops being used like that. He would think it unmanly.
Such a plan cannot be countenanced by the Emperor at the moment. You must act without us.
Emperors do not bare their necks, even to the friendliest of foreign tyrants.
I have given ear to your terms but the Emperor will, quite rightly, be deaf to this idea.
I fear we will now disappoint you. The Emperor would dislike your men kicking up the dust in our lands.
Merchants do not rule here, and so the Emperor does not pay taxes to others.
The Emperor has the keys to the state's coffers. They will stay firmly shut.
Why, in God's name, would the Emperor wish to punish honest men\? So, I say in his name: no!
I am reasonably confident that the Emperor would have me say no to this ridiculous suggestion.
The Empire's defences do not need another ditch, and our people do not hide behind others.
Your scheme shows all the cunning of your people, but it does not meet with Imperial approval. No, then.
Thank you, but the Empire has no need of defenders at the moment. It has all of our strength at its back!
The Emperor has seen no merit in such a marriage between states. We will stand, properly virginal, without you!
We are strong enough alone. We must decline, then, but the Emperor will note your offer with due respect.
God would turn his back on us if I heeded this foolish, weakling's proposal.
The Emperor will not accept such a thing. Our soldiers hunger for glory and are not done feasting!
I am not surprised you want peace but, sadly for your people, the Emperor has little mercy.
Such wealth as you possess you need, to buy, most urgently, the necessaries of culture and civilization.
The Emperor, like all great men, enjoys wealth, but he do not want your wealth.
A worthy gesture, but one that is declined. The Emperor will only wonder what lies behind such a gift.
A gold coin cannot turn aside all the swords we have charged, or change the Emperor's worthy opinion.
Remove your filth from Roman lands. March away. Do not come again. So speaks the Emperor of all Rome!
The presence of your puny forces on Roman land has caused offence to the Emperor! Remove them!
The Emperor feels that an attack here would be of great mutual benefit. Could you arrange such an offensive\?
In his wisdom, and military genius, the Emperor feels that your aid in defence would be timely. Will you help\?
The Emperor sends word that your warriors must leave Roman territory. For now, he asks in friendship and with courtesy.
I am the agent of the Emperor in this simple matter: will you hand over these lands, or not\?
The Emperor bids me ask that you hand over these lands. It is a reasonable request.
The Emperor requires me to ask, politely, if his troops may enter your lands in pursuit of our legitimate strategies.
The Emperor requests that his generals be allowed to march their troops across your lands.
The time has come to be wise. Heed this, the Emperor's generous offer, and accept him as your master in all things.
Surely you will now see wisdom in the Emperor's offer: become his servants, and glory will forever flow over you!
The Emperor has lavish tastes. He will fondly remember those who fund such tastes.
The Emperor is known to have lavish tastes. He may remember with fondness those who help fund such tastes.
I fear we test the patience of Christ himself. We seem destined to part without agreement.
Praise be to God! Let us have an end of talk, then, and meet as proper men in open battle!
Pray to your false gods. Your foolishness has awoken the might and anger of the Emperor.
An end to talk. The Emperor will be pleased to add your lands to his domains!
So be it. You invite a storm and the Legions will gladly bring one to your door!
You have destroyed yourself today. You have orphaned children and despoiled your women. By God, these things will happen!
The Emperor will turn to his Legions and they will set their swords to your people.
Your words are wise, and the people will find much satisfaction in hearing them.
I will give voice to the acceptance of your proposal.
I accept! The gods, the People and all of the world will welcome your wisdom.
With such an arrangement, you and your people show honour to rival that of any modest man.
The gods are pleased by your words. Our people, too, will be satisfied.
So it is done! I almost heard the public murmur of approval at this outcome.
My people would rightly question my moon-struck stupidity if I accepted such a proposal.
An eagle flew around my head three times on my way here! Consider your offer rejected!
I will speak as the noble Senators would and, finding little worth in your words, decline.
Our collective will is clear in this matter, and your proposal has little worthy of agreement.
I cannot. I dare not! The gates would rightly close in my face were I to accept.
I fear acceptance will not find a home in my heart. The people will not accept such an arrangement.
We are willing to stand against these people, if you think such efforts will help your cause.
Do you need help in this matter\? You need only ask, and we will see it done.
The Legions are at your disposal if you require our strength.
We strongly urge you to attack here, and to do this with a Roman efficiency!
I am sure that you will agree with our wisdom, and see the absolute necessity for an attack here.
This is no time for timidity! In Rome's name, I insist that your armies march against these creatures!
More defenders are needed. I trust that we can rely on your prompt and fulsome support.
We feel sure that you will be of one mind with us, and see that defence here is necessary.
I am instructed to ask-- no, demand-- that you aid in the defence against these people!
I will speak plainly of the Senate's wishes: remove your troops. Immediately.
I must be direct: the Senate and the People can no longer stomach your troops on Roman lands. Remove them!
The Senate demands that your warriors leave our lands. We have fine roads to the borders: use them!
There is little to be argued in this matter as I am sure you see: these lands are Roman, and should be under our control.
The Senators are confident that you will see sense, and hand these lands over for proper and Roman government.
These lands are surely mismanaged without Roman order. Do you not have the wisdom hand them over\?
You would be foolish indeed to stand in the path of the Legions.
We are suggesting that you wisely open your borders to our Legions.
Come now, see sense. The gods insist that our soldiers be allowed to march where they will in your lands.
There is much wisdom in accepting us, in our nobility, as your new masters and protectors.
There is wisdom is accepting the rule of the righteous, and the protection of the Legions.
Look forward to a life of comfort, justice and peace as a client of us and our mighty gods!
You are overburdened with a large sum that could rightly be lodged in our coffers.
There is good sense in contributing to our coffers, so reducing many future perils.
Come now, your riches are an embarrassment, and we would spare your blushes by relieving you of coin.
Obedience and honesty are treasured in our lands, but so too is gold, given freely, and often.
We value friendship, and look forward to receiving gold in abundance as a token of goodwill.
While we have no claim to your wealth, perhaps goodwill leads to sharing\? The gods would surely approve.
Your wisdom would be obvious to all the world if you heed my words, those of a plain-speaking Roman.
I am commanded to speak in the name of my people. Heed, then, most carefully, this proposal.
I speak as the representative of my most august people. You would do well to listen.
I speak with the voice of my people. You should carefully consider this offer.
You should be honoured that I make such an offer in the name of a noble people.
Come now, this offer is a good and honest one, and you should give it sensible consideration.
The gods themselves would not make you a better offer, my friend, so think carefully on my words here today.
There is much honour in accepting this offer, for it is fair and just, like all Roman ideas.
Give careful attention, and then careful consideration in your wisdom to my words.
Come now, the gods themselves would listen carefully to an offer such as this.
Your honeyed words and offers ring false to honest ears.
Ha! This particular Vestal virgin will keep virtue and worth, despite your cunning tongue!
No. No. I think that the people's deliberations should not be troubled with your words.
This proposal need not occupy my attention. You have said little of worth and I reject your offer.
I do not think I can countenance such an agreement. Therefore, consider it refused.
There is little worth in the these terms. I cannot agree with you.
I have generously given time and ear to these words, but I cannot agree with their import.
I struggle to find merit in your words. We cannot agree to your offer.
Ha! I know the people would laugh at such an offer, therefore I will laugh at it too!
For my part, the omens for this meeting were bad. Such is the will of the Gods, it seems.
A fishwife would rightly throw such stinking fare back in your insolent face.
Do not presume that we are stupid, callow and easily swayed. Your proposal has no merit!
Our people will correctly regard you as contemptible, unworthy and base because of this childish proposal.
You think us simple folk\? You mistake honesty for idiocy. We can reach little agreement here!
You are brave indeed to rouse our ire! What overheats your spleen or troubles your bowels\?
Never presume on our noble and forgiving nature. Your proposal is insulting to anyone's dignity!
I will not trouble my people with your insolence. My own anger cannot echo but one thousandth part of their wrath!
Great gods of Rome! Grant me forbearance should they ever hear of this insulting offer!
Why do you speak with mocking tongue\? I would face the lash for even repeating such stupidities.
I see you jest! Or is it an absence of wits\? Or simple, ugly and dangerous disrespect\?
Your proposals have some merit, but I cannot accept on my people's behalf.
You speak well in your cause, but I am not entirely persuaded. I regretfully, and respectfully say no.
I am sure you speak with an honest tongue but, for us, I cannot greet your words with approval.
Granted, you have spoken well and set out honest terms but they are not terms we can accept.
You are plainly a man of honour and no little wisdom, but your terms are unacceptable.
This offer is made in good faith and, in a spirit of honesty, I must reject it.
I could not, in honour, return having accepted such an offer. Therefore, for my people, I reject it.
Your advocacy was most skilled. On behalf of my people, I give voice to an honest and respectful refusal of your offer.
We rightly hold you in respect, for your words and deeds are honest and honourable. However, we cannot agree to your proposal.
You are a servant of the gods, so sweetly do you speak! But we cannot be seduced, even by such a gallant display!
Patience is a Roman virtue, but the day has now grown too old for further talk.
My throat aches for good wine. Further talk is less to my taste.
I have sat and listened until I could cry out for mercy! We demand much, but not such discomfort!
We ask patience of our servants, but you have tried mine to breaking and beyond. Enough!
My mouth is as dry as a Legionary's sandal! We are done here. Let us cease talk and find wine!
This meal of words has stuffed my belly. I will rise from the table, and seek other pleasures!
I am certain that, with your famed wisdom, you can see that we benefit from your friendship, and you from ours.
I respectfully request that we co-operate fully in opposing our many enemies and rivals.
We always remember, with honour, those we consider to be friends. Do you not wish to be counted in that number\?
We are not a friend for the new moon and an enemy in the old. Come, can we not help each other openly\?
We are a proud people, and would be proud to count you among our friends.
As long as our strength remains, we would be honoured to count you as friends and more.
We respectfully ask for peace. What good is war\?
Your people have demonstrated much courage, but is it not time to now put aside the sword\?
Our Legions and your armies have long contended in the field but the people feel that the time for peace has come.
Your warriors do you much credit. Now, can your diplomats and envoys be equally worthy in seeking peace\?
As enemies you have been without equal in courage and honour. Now, however, we wish only peace with you.
We do not offer peace easily but, to such as you, there is no shame is asking whether or not the time of peace is upon us.
Your fine goods would be welcomed in our cities! Trade would see us all prosper, do you not think\?
We admire your merchants and their wares. We would both gain if trade was open between us.
There is much to value in the goods of your merchants. Will you not send them into our lands\?
I will be plain, in proper Roman fashion. We both have enemies, open and otherwise. Co-operation would be sensible.
Formal co-operation, brokered in good faith by honest men, would of mutual advantage.
This hand, stretched forth in friendship, is unwisely ignored. Consider carefully your next words.
We do not offer our protection to any passing stranger, so think carefully on what you say next.
We have decided, in our wisdom, that your people would make worthy allies. I suggest you grasp this opportunity for co-operation.
Strength can be found in friendship, between men and between peoples. We feel that we could be better friends.
Peace, honestly forged between men, is a worthy thing. What say you\?
An offer of peace from us should not be spurned. Now, what say you\?
Much blood has been spilled. I suggest that we agree terms to staunch the flow on both sides.
Many good men have died in our wars. Our people look to find terms that will bring rest to all our swords.
Our war has brought bloodshed, but without gain or progress. Let us end this senseless conflict for the good of all.
We see no profit in continuing hostility. Let us move towards peace.
Trade with us would surely bring benefits to your merchants, and our traders.
Our merchants trade as they are told. What of yours\? Would you have coin\?
Trade prosperity and comforts for both our peoples. We hope you agree to such a future.
The Senate and People consider that you would be a suitable steward for these lands, if you will accept them.
The august and noble Senate sees fit to give you these lands to rule as you wish!
The Senate are minded that you would be worthy to rule these lands.
Our money reflects an accurate appreciation of your worth.
The tangible good wishes of our people are offered only to those considered worthy.
Our coffers bulge, and we consider that your people are worthy to gain from the surplus.
We consider it wise to seek co-operation between us, to the hopeful ruination of our mutual foes. And you\?
An alliance would truly benefit us all and keep enemies suitably awed. Will you move to meet us on this\?
The people see you as worthy allies and suggest that you consider an alliance.
Should we co-operate, our enemies would cower and seek safety. Do you not think that a fine prospect\?
Have you not noticed that a marriage, properly contracted and considered, can be harmonious even between unlikely partners\?
We believe that co-operation rather than hostility would serve us both well in the trying days ahead.
We see no gain in further bloodshed and seek an honourable end to the war between us.
We have grown weary of this war and have other uses for the Legions. We therefore seek peace with you.
Both our peoples have suffered without gain from this war. It is time to end the killing.
This war is of no benefit to us or you. There is merit in seeking peace now.
The gods are unhappy at our bickering. There is no point in further bloodshed. What say you to peace\?
We seek an end to this bitter, profitless conflict. What say on you on terms of peace\?
There is profit for all in letting our merchants sell in your lands. What say you to such an arrangement\?
Our wares have merits which would appeal to your people, and trade enriches all. What say you\?
The gods would surely smile on us all if merchants passed between our lands. What say you\?
We do not give gifts lightly, and never to common folk.
Our favour and friendship is rarely expressed in such golden terms.
We find you worthy of benefitting from our prosperity.
Be welcome! Let us talk, and then enjoy good Roman wine when we have agreement!
Be most welcome. Your words will find an attentive audience!
In our good name, be welcome, and speak in friendship! I will give a receptive ear to your words.
Welcome, welcome, my friend. I will give ear to you, and give tongue to the people's words!
You will find me a willing and attentive audience for your speech. Give tongue to your words, and I will answer.
Welcome, and let us be honoured by your attendance and your words.
Your people's reputation goes before you. Find a welcome here, and speak as you wish.
The gods bless us with your presence today. I will doubtless find pleasure in your wisdom here.
On behalf of our people, welcome. Speak, friend, and honour us all with wit and wisdom.
Hail! As requested, I give ear to your just and undoubtedly noble requests!
Speak, if you must, but know that our ears have little liking for foreign babble!
Speak quickly, but do not expect the good wine to ease your parched throat when you are done!
Greetings in the name of the state, and so forth. Now, what do you want\?
Speak your speech, so that I may go to the baths and wash away today's stench.
Welcome, I suppose. NO! Do not sit. That is for us, and for friends. You, for now, will stand.
Speak your terms. Give words plentiful haste. Other business calls this day.
Welcome, but expect scant pleasantries. I lack time to waste.
Come then, speak. The people will consider what I hear, but you must speak without delay.
Do not waste time on pleasantries and babble. Speak what you must, and be done.
You are welcome, but that welcome can become a farewell if you waste my time.
My salutations, and the good wishes of our people to you and yours! Of what would you speak\?
In the name of the state, welcome. Speak as a friend or as an enemy, but do so with honesty.
I welcome you on behalf of the people, and give ear to your words.
Be welcome. I listen and speak for my people in our dealings today.
The day's greetings to you. Speak, for you have my attention as the ear of the august people.
Welcome, worthy guest. I trust you bring words that will enhance the honour of your people in our eyes.
We are, as always, a welcoming host to you. I await your words with an appetite for truth!
Welcome, worthy friend. I trust you bring words that honour both your people and ours.
For my people's part, welcome. For my part, welcome also, and give me your wisdom.
We offer you honest welcome. Speak, friend and, hopefully, later we will drink to seal our agreement!
You expect too much. Our lives will not be thrown away on such a foolish adventure!
We do not bite like dogs at your command! Never that! You march alone on this.
Who are you to throw the Legions into battle\? Your plans are those of shallow, vain people soaked in stupidity!
Gods give me patience! We will never agree to throwing away lives in such a futile way.
We will not spend a single coin or life to defend these pigs in their pigsty. Let them burn!
We will not use the Legions in such a way. Only the Consul and the will of the gods move Roman soldiers!
Doubtless you think your offer reeks of wit. As a man of sense, I think otherwise.
By the gods! You must think me mad or stupid, or both, to ask such a thing!
You really expect us to bend to your will\? You are mad. Does it run in your family\?
We do not require, or want, foreigners - desperately in need of a bath, the lot of them - tramping over Roman lands.
Any Senator would be more likely to bed the King of the Moon People than to agee your lunacy!
Our lands will not be a road for your vagabonds. Have them walk another way, and downwind of good Romans!
The state coffers are wisely locked to prevent theft by insolent  brigands.
Our physicians have leeches enough to bleed us without needing a nation of such creatures giving suck!
Bandit! Thief! Whoremonger! You cannot dip your hand into our purse on a whim!
You expect golden trinkets to adorn your wives! Those perfidious harpies normally settle for a little blood!
Our purse is not to be plundered to satisfy the over-confident greed of brigands and vagabonds!
You are most insolent, and here insolence is usually repaid with the whip!
The man who could obey one of you without vomiting through contempt has yet to be born!
You expect us to be your catamites and whores\? Slavery will never be our lot!
The sun does not rise and at set your whim, and likewise we do not heed your bleating!
The Senate would have me thrown from the Tarpeian Rock for even listening to this hare-brained suggestion. And you with me!
I have no wish to be hurled from the Tarpeian Rock, thank you. I will never commit treachery by agreeing!
This is insanity! Rome will not loosen her grip on any lands for you!
Perhaps I should form an alliance with slaves in my vineyards\? Or with passing lepers\? Bah!
Lacking a blind, insane or diseased man to agree with your proposal, you will have to look elsewhere!
Do not imagine you can climb into a our bed in search of warmth! Dogs stay in kennels!
Why should a man shackle himself to a corpse, and imagine safety in the act\?
You seek a good marriage with us, and yet you have only the charm of an uncommonly ugly fishwife!
I can almost hear the laughter of the Gods. You have stupidity that would pass for courage to ask such a thing!
Peace\? Peace\? Peace! Do you think us ruled by old women and dotards unable to lift the sword\?
Our wits are not entirely fled, our courage not entirely spent, and you still rut in your hovels! Peace\? Pah!
You speak of peace when our blood cries out for vengeance and Legionary swords are not yet blunted with killing\? Never!
You want an end to this\? I am not surprised, your weakness of stomach is well known.
Our Legions will go on spilling your blood. It is of no use inside you, after all!
Your demands are weak and feeble-minded. Once roused, our hunger for blood is bottomless!
Wash your goods in vinegar to remove the stench and, even then, our merchants would not waste their coin!
You may love a good haggling like women over onions and goats and fish. We have a state to run!
We have no taste for your repulsive, ill-made trinkets and sullied goods.
Your virtue may be available in the market, but honesty is prized above any coin.
Pah! We are not common mercenaries, to be bought with your bread, salt and coin!
We find no pleasure in taking your gold except, perhaps, from your burning homes!
We are not whores and costermongers to be bought for a handful of coin.
You insult us twice over in one babbling utterance! We do not want your gold, or so little of it!
The people would see me experience the lictors' whips if I accepted your crude offer!
Such an attack might be prudent, but I do not believe the consuls will make troops available.
The people see little need to expend swords and coin from the purse on ill-judged adventures.
Our Legions have their orders. Sadly for you their orders do not include acting on your orders.
I do not think that the people would approve of troops being used like that. They would think it unmanly.
Such a plan cannot be countenanced at the moment. You must act without us.
We have no wish to see these lands suffer a conqueror's tread, yet we cannot march to defend them.
We do not bare their necks, even to the friendliest of foreign tyrants.
You are blessed by a sort of wit, but your humour is not to our tastes.
I have given ear to your terms but we will, quite rightly, be deaf to this idea.
We do not open our gates to passing ruffians.
And why would we agree to anything so absurd\? We are not yet touched by senility and madness!
I fear we will now disappoint you. The people would dislike your men kicking up the dust in their lands.
Merchants do not rule here, and so we do not pay taxes to others.
Sadly, our coffers will remain firmly closed. Our gold does not travel well.
Empty our coffers\? I do not see how this benefits us at any time, or in any way.
Our coinage sits ill in foreign, duplicitous purses. Or so I am told.
We do not open our purse to fill the bowl of a passing beggar.
I have the keys to our coffers. They will stay firmly shut.
I cannot think of a Roman who would endure such a forced marriage and not kill himself within a day!
Why, in God's name, would the people wish to punish honesty\? So, I say in their name: no!
What\? Shackle ourselves like common slaves\? Are you are aware that you address a Roman\?
I am reasonably confident that the Senate and People of Rome would have me say no to this ridiculous suggestion.
I can safely speak for all Rome in this matter, and say that such a change of ownership is a not going to happen just yet.
Rome holds those lands fondly to her bosom. The suggestion that they be handed has scant merit.
We thrive in foreign ventures only when such works are subject to sensible direction.
The state's defences do not need another ditch, and we do not hide behind others.
Your scheme shows all the cunning of your people, but it does not meet with our approval. No, then.
Thank you, but the state has no need of defenders at the moment. They have the Legions at their backs!
We see no merit in such a marriage between states. We will stand, properly virginal, without you!
We are strong enough alone. We must decline, then, but the Consul will note your offer with due respect.
The gods would turn their backs on us if I heeded this foolish, weakling's proposal.
Our righteous anger is not yet spent. Peace does not interest the state, nor does it interest me!
Stop the Legions\? I fear not. Our men must have their glory and plunder!
We will not accept such a thing. Our soldiers hunger for glory and are not done feasting!
I am not surprised you want peace but, sadly for your people, we have little mercy.
There is a time for talk and for peace. Today is not the day.
Our good taste does not demand the fripperies and geegaws that you offer in trade.
Trade with you\? We do not believe in wasting the time of honest merchants.
I am sure your goods are worthy, but we have no taste for them at this time.
Such wealth as you possess you need, to buy, most urgently, the necessaries of culture and civilization.
Like all great men, we enjoy wealth, but we do not want your wealth.
A worthy gesture, but one that is declined. We can only wonder what lies behind such a gift.
A gold coin cannot turn aside all the swords of the state, or change the people's worthy opinion.
Our favour is neither sold nor bought with your coin.
Such gifts often come with a heavy price. We must decline your kind offer.
Remove your filth from Roman lands. March away. Do not come again. So speaks the Senate, and all of Rome!
You try Roman patience too far! Remove your foul little armies from our lands immediately!
The presence of your puny forces on Roman land has caused offence in the Senate! Remove them!
An attack would be prudent. What say your generals\? Are they courageous\? Are they eager\?
The generals feels that an attack here would be of great mutual benefit. Could you arrange such an offensive\?
We have much respect for your might. Will you justify our admiration and act in this instance\?
The wise council of defence must prevail: can you not send aid here\?
In his wisdom, and military genius, the Consul feels that your aid in defence would be timely. Will you help\?
The state calls on your armies. There is a threat from these people and we must both guard against it.
The Senate sends word that your warriors must leave Roman territory. For now, they ask in friendship and with courtesy.
In the name of Rome, I ask that you remove your warriors, who appear to have strayed into our lands, doubtless by mistake…
Even the most welcome guests grow wearisome. Rome requests you take your armies off our lands.
I am the agent of the Senate in this simple matter: will you hand over these lands, or not\?
The Senate bids me ask that you hand over these lands. It is a reasonable request.
There are few hands safer than those of a Roman and these lands cry out for a Roman's touch.
The people require me to ask, politely, if the Legions may enter your lands in pursuit of our legitimate strategies.
The Consul requests that his generals be allowed to march their troops across your lands.
The Legions require passage through your lands, for purposes both noble and honest.
The time has come to be wise. Heed this, the state's generous offer, and accept us as your master in all things.
Surely you will now see wisdom in the state's offer: become our servants, and glory will flow over you!
Your people would surely offer thanks if you accept our terms. We are noble and generous masters.
Surely you would wish to be honoured as a friend by contributing to our coffers\?
Come, come! Open your purse and allow the eagle to wet its beak a little!
Some of our men have, I am told, lavish tastes. They will fondly remember those who fund such tastes.
We do not ask much, merely a contribution towards the Legions, those trusty guarantors of peace for all.
Some in the state are known to have lavish tastes. These men remember with fondness those who help fund such tastes.
We know that wealth can be a burden. Will you not allow us to lighten your load a little\?
You would be better regarded in our lands if you gave a gift to demonstrate your worth.
Your people have wealth and goods in abundance, enought for a gift. Will you not look to it\?
There are arrangements to be made between us. Perhaps a gift fitting Roman dignity would sway our words today.
Enough! Enough! Your words are as endless and pointless as the barking of wild dogs.
Even I, an envoy well used to bureaucracy, grow weary of endless chattering. And so, good day to you.
I fear that the day has run out, as has my backside's endurance. I must away and deal with other business.
This has been a tiresome chase and still we are no nearer to our quarry. I think we should end our talks.
I fear we test the patience of the gods themselves. We seem destined to part without agreement.
I am here to find terms that will be welcome at home, but I grow weary of this indecisive chatter.
Praise be! Let us have an end of talk, then, and meet as proper men in open battle!
Pray to the gods of the dead. Your foolishness has awoken the might and anger of the dread Legions.
An end to talk. The people will be pleased to add your lands to our domains!
We all look forward to seeing your leaders strangled, very, very slowly, during the triumphal celebrations!
How would you like your defeat commemorated\? An arch\? Or a nice column, or by the wailing of your enslaved people\?
So be it. You invite a storm and we will gladly aid the gods in bringing one to you!
You have brought this on yourselves. Your people will curse your name when rivers run red with their blood.
You have destroyed yourself today. You have orphaned children and despoiled your women. By gods, these things will happen!
So you choose the sword. I trust your people will rightly thank you for bringing them a Roman war.
The people will turn to the Legions and they will set their swords to your people.
