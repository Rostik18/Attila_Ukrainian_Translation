Husband, what a fuss there was yesterday! However, I’m sure you just needed some time to calm down before you could clearly see the truth. I don’t want your apologies, but you will feel very silly once you hear what actually happened.\n\nTheo and I were burying treasure in the basement! You worked so hard in Carthage winning all that plunder and now Justinian just expects you to hand it over when all he did was sit on his throne looking pompous. I was hiding a few nice bits and pieces from the taxmen so you can keep the reward you really deserve. It was only afterwards that we realised how compromising it all looked! How silly! Anyway, once you’ve calmed down I’ll send you the money and we can forget all about it.
My husband, I hear you have been campaigning awfully hard against those Vandals so I thought I would cheer you up. Anyway, I remembered how much you love charity and I got you a special surprise: a new son! You remember your poor orphan godson, Theodosius\? Well he’s taken such good care of me that he simply has to join the family. He’s so charming and handsome people are practically queueing up to adopt him. Say you’ll let me keep him, please\?\n\nOh, by the way, I’ve been spending time entertaining some of the bright young minds of Constantinople (they all use such charmingly long words – have you ever heard ‘inveigle’\?) and one of them has a way of keeping water fresh that would be an absolute life saver on your campaign in dusty old Africa. If you do me the favour I asked I would be delighted to procure his secrets for you in no time…
Ave, Belisarius! Word of your continuing success resounds in my ears day and night – it would seem that you are driving the Ostrogoths from Italy with your own two arms, the way they talk! I must confess I find myself frustrated with the focus on personal works of valour rather than reconquest… But no matter, while it progresses, I am happy regardless.\n\nIndeed, in order to speed our undertaking and lift this unnaturally heavy burden from your shoulders I have dispatched Narses to help you. He is tactically astute and, best of all, loyal. He seeks no personal glory and can be trusted implicitly. Please do not see his appointment as a slight – after your recent successes there is no question of that – but instead as a reward. He will be most useful; I insist that you test his mettle for yourself in the heat of battle.
Ave, Belisarius! It is so often the case that the man who distinguishes himself most highly in battle finds himself losing the same struggle in his very home. One thinks of King Ahab, mighty in battle and politics, so under the sway of his evil wife, Jezebel, that God destroyed him and brought low his kingdom.\n\nSo you see a matter that seems private and outside the remit of the sovereign is in fact a matter closely entwined with the fortunes of Empire. Belisarius, you are aware that your importance is second to none. It is only right, therefore, that you are scrutinised above all others. Your wife, Antonina, has been stirring scandal for some time in the capital. Some of my most valuable agents have been undermined by her behaviour and I hear that her latest scheme is directed at her own son! I will tolerate it no longer.\n\nIt pains me to send such an ultimatum to one who has served me so well, but I am confident that this action will benefit you above all others. You must shun the council of your wife. That is all.
Greetings, General Belisarius. I write to you on the recommendation of your good wife, who is a friend from my youth. You are aware, no doubt, that I strictly limit my involvement in politics to allow me to focus on charitable works. The fact that I am writing to you demonstrates the extreme seriousness of the situation.\n\nMy husband, the Emperor, is a good man, but occasionally needs a loving hand to set him straight. You are no doubt aware that Amalasuntha, the Ostrogothic queen, has been imprisoned by her own people. Justinian has resolved to release her, but I fear that his motives are not pure. The woman is a serpent – she has twined her way around my husband’s heart. Can you imagine the shame\? The glorious Roman Emperor under the thumb of a barbarian whore\?\n\nI know that the Emperor has given orders to see her freed. If you truly wish to serve him and the Empire, you will ensure that the mission fails. I will soften my husband’s wrath and compensate you far better than he would. Your wife assures me that I can count on your discretion in this matter…
My heartiest congratulations, Belisarius, on the news of your daughter’s impending matrimony! Anastasius is my favourite nephew, and I know he will make sweet Ioannina very happy. It’s an auspicious thing to see families - until now linked so closely by the bonds of friendship, patriotism and loyalty – finally linked by the bond of holy marriage.\n\nNo doubt your wife has explained the unusual nature of their relationship at present and my role in facilitating it. It is indeed not ideal for them to be living together in carnal union before the ceremony itself, but it seemed unavoidable considering the love of the couple and the frequent postponements your wife insisted on. I know she is furious at her daughter’s lost ‘virtue’, but in my mind, the timing of the consummation is secondary to the pure intent to marry, and surely god, who sees all motives, will see this above all else. Perhaps she forgets, Belisarius, that her own virtue was hardly intact when the two of you entered your blessed union. Restrain her from rash action, bless this union, and this unpleasant situation can only be turned to good.
Belisarius, by all accounts you are among the blessed cohort of men whose earthly deeds are exceeded only by the many services they render to our Lord. Men who, like you, esteem the next life over their present situation always rejoice to hear of new opportunities with which to build the Kingdom of Heaven on this broken earth.\n\nRejoice then Belisarius, at the charge I bring you today. The Pope installed by the Goths, Silverus, is corrupt in both spirit and mind. Letters supporting the Ostrogothic rebels have been found in his possession and, while rumours circulate regarding their legitimacy, there is no doubt in my mind of their veracity. Many times have I tried to bring him into communion with the clergy in Constantinople but have found him to be willfully divisive. As Pope he will lead thousands into the damnation of heresy - a sin which outweighs any temporal trespass!\n\nThe Emperor talks of delicacy and reconciliation and will not act, but I know in his heart he longs for someone to take care of this problem for him – will you be his Holy warrior\?
The harvest this year has been especially plentiful. What should we do with the excess\?
During the games at the Colosseum in Rome, a man named Telemachus stepped down into the arena. Rushing up to the fighters, he implored them to stop, but was struck down and killed. As a result of this crime the Christian community has demanded that the games be banned.
Walking through the wreckage of a conquered settlement, one of your generals hears a cry. It is a baby, abandoned in the ruins!
There are a large number of Arians living in our lands. Should they be granted the same rights as true believers\?
The number of Latin Christians in our provinces is very high. How should they be treated\?
Many pagans, followers of the Celtic gods, fill our lands. Do they deserve equal rights\?
AD411, Carthage. The Berber Christians follow the laws of Donatism, believing that theirs is the only true Church, and that all other Christians receive false sacraments. Marcellinus, who is presiding, asks whether we should tolerate such a thing within the Empire\?
AD418, Carthage. Priests from around the Christian world have met at Carthage once again. The ascetic, Pelagius, preaches that God is not required to cleanse us of sin and that original sin never occurred. Many claim that this is heresy and that Pelagius and his followers should be driven out.
AD431, Ephesus. Bishops from around the Christian world have gathered at Ephesus to reaffirm the Nicene Creed. However, Nestorius, Archbishop of Constantinople, has been denounced by his peers for rejecting that Mary was the mother of God, claiming instead that she was only the mother of Jesus. This goes against the Nicene creed by separating Jesus from God. As a result, Cyril of Alexandria is demanding that the Pope declares Nestorianism a heretical viewpoint.
AD400, Toledo, Spain. A gathering of nineteen bishops have affirmed the Nicene Creed. However, the matter of Priscillian is a point of contention; even though their leader has died his heretical sect continues to attract followers. Should we tolerate this sect\?
A Synod has been called, deciding that the dualist beliefs of the Manichaeists have been infecting the lives of otherwise good Christians. The Pope has sent a letter, stating that the Manichaean heretics should be driven from our lands.
Many pagans, followers of the Germanic gods, fill our lands. Do they deserve equal rights\?

Reports have arrived claiming that the great Ma'rib Dam is showing signs of weakness, with many saying that cracks are now appearing. We should act now if we are to prevent the damage escalating - even attempting some minor repairs could lessen the potential damage and reduce the risk of flooding.

Long have we tolerated your adherence to this foreign and unholy religion. At the beginning of your reign you assured us that we would be allowed to flourish unthreatened by your beliefs, but it is clear to us now that these were empty words and that your true goal is the eradication of our faith and all who believe in it. It is too late for us to try to turn back the tide, but we demand the means to protect ourselves. Provide us with a gift of gold so that we may live according to our conscience and without fear of hardship. I make this request humbly, but know this: my followers are desperate men, and I fear blood will be spilled should they be denied. Choose more wisely than you have done thus far, my lord.

The Sassanid king, your overlord, has invited you to dine in the majestic summer palace he had you build just outside of Hira. His tongue loosened by the wine, the Shahanshah launches into an unprovoked attack on the character of your people:\nI see no good in the Arabs – materially and spiritually – they have no force or power in them, their place is with the beasts! They are deprived of the good things life offers: good food, drink and dress. Their food is camel meat, which even the lions refuse to eat because of its bad taste. How do you abide the kingship of these worthless people\?
The Shahanshah rolls his eyes exaggeratedly and staggers to his feet.\nIf only my subject was as full of wisdom as he is pride! If you Arabs feed a guest they count it as a virtue, and of this their poets sing – they are lowly, poor and miserable and yet they are so proud and arrogant. They do not complain of hunger, poverty and misery and put themselves above all other nations – so of what are you so proud\?
Far from placating the Shahanshah, your agreement seems only to have fuelled his mockery.\nWhere is the pride for which the Arabs are so famous\? Surely you have a word to say in defence of your people, or a rebuke concerning the dissolution in which you perceive me to possess\? Perhaps now that you have tasted the ways by which my people live, you have lost your fondness for the meanness and denial of your previous existence. It has pleased me to have a people so spirited under my command, but it would please me yet more to break their spirit. Say now that you prefer the traditions of the Sassanids over those of your own people and I will look upon you with great favour.
As promised, now that we have established a permanent base our allies have offered to put their lands and citizens at our disposal. This new empire of the east is ours to rule! But perhaps we are being too hasty\? With these new lands we will inherit their old problems, their obligations and their demands. Perhaps it is better to be free of all this, free as the wind that shapes the dunes…\? You may decide. It pleases me to reward you thus. Choose the fate of the Tanukhs! Lead us forth as an empire of the sand!

The tension all around the realm is palpable; it is time for you to decide your course of action in the matter of Carloman’s succession. This moment could be remembered for all time as the one in which the fate of all the Franks was decided. If you truly believe you are the rightful claimant to all of Carloman’s lands, then now is the time to strike. It will require military action to put down those loyal to him, but given the fractured state of affairs in his lands it may deal a decisive blow and end any conflict swiftly. However, should you choose to support Carloman’s son as the claimant to his lands, then a long-lasting, positive relationship could be built between your peoples; perhaps two Frankish kingdoms, firmly united, are as good as one\? Make your choice, Charlemagne, your future awaits!
The indiscretions of youth reveal themselves, Charlemagne, and now the father must pay for the sins of the child. Your daughter, whom you had thought beyond reproach and the victim of unfounded rumours, has revealed these rumours to be true. Your discovery of her with a local boy has sparked outrage; her name is on everybody’s lips, and your reputation is at stake. You can silence these murmurings in one of two ways – by reprimanding her, or by reprimanding the rumour-mongers.
The Abbasid Caliphate, which controls the great swathe of lands from Africa to the Levant, threatens your shores. They muster their men as a show of strength on the shores of northern Africa, threatening to cross the straits and invade your lands. They say that if you were to pay them a tribute, however, they would put away their swords. Perhaps with your money in their hands they will be able to muster the strength to actually defeat you and conquer your lands\? Whatever your decision, the people of the Iberian Peninsula wait with bated breath the results of the parley between you.
Over thirty years ago, at the request of Pope Stephen II, the then Frankish king - Pepin, father of Charlemagne - crossed the Alps and defeated the Lombards under King Aistulf. Believing Aistulf was preparing to take Rome after his recent conquests in the Exarchate of Ravenna, the Pope felt threatened and called for Pepin’s support. After the victory, Pepin promised to cede all lands previously conquered by the Lombards, in an act that has come to be known as the Donation of Pepin. Now, all these years later, Pope Adrian I has demanded cessation of the region of Ravenna as part of the terms of this historic promise. Whether to adhere to this old agreement is your choice to make, but know that your decision is likely to have lasting effects whatever the outcome.
Infuriated by your refusal, the Pope is seeking the support of the Franks, who made the agreement in the first place. As such, he has sent an envoy to Charlemagne’s court entreating his support in this matter; you too must quickly choose a course of action and dispatch an envoy if war is to be avoided.
You have received a letter from Charlemagne explaining that his support of the Pope and the Church is non-negotiable. As such, he has demanded your compliance with any and all Papal demands for territory under the terms of the Donation of Pepin. Failure to accede to the Pope’s demand for Ravenna and will result in war between your two peoples.
My lord! Your man, Alcuin of York, faces a crisis of loyalty. He has been approached by the Frankish king, Charlemagne, and invited to take a place at his court. Alcuin, as you surely know, is one of the finest minds in the realm, and a great boon to your court. Yet the opportunity at Aachen appeals greatly to Alcuin, who feels he cannot refuse the chance to work with the greatest brains in the known world. He bequeaths you to allow him to leave for Francia immediately.
Alcuin is, as you might expect, angry at your decision to detain him and effectively curtail his academic career. You expected this, but not his decision to leave anyway, regardless of your decision to the contrary. Another crossroads is coming, my lord, and another decision comes along with it.
Intrigue stirs at the heart of the Papal States. Bloodied and desperate, Pope Leo III has arrived at your court, seeking your protection - as the only arbiter the Christian world truly trusts. Roma has always suffered bitter divisions between rivals, now it appears that the family and allies of the old Pope, Adrian, have taken exception to Leo. After their accusations of adultery and perjury fell on deaf ears, their agents apprehended him as he ventured from the city, trying to tear out his eyes and tongue to render him unfit for office. Now he comes to you, filled with hope by your past actions to protect his holy office in times past. He hints that your help in this matter would demonstrate your worthiness to assume the most coveted title of all – that of the Holy Roman Emperor. His opponents, however, offer a hefty reward to anyone who hands Leo back, to stand trial in Roma…
Thirty two years ago your father, the Frankish king, Pepin, at the request of the then threatened Pope, led an army against the Lombards and forced their surrender. In doing so, he transferred many of their captured lands to the Pope, an act known as the “Donation of Pepin”. Pope Adrian has now called upon the Lombards to honour this promise and cede Ravenna to the Papal States, but the current Lombard king has refused to do so. As a result, the Pope has sent an envoy to your court beseeching you to you enforce the promise your father once made. The Lombard king, Desiderius, has also sent an envoy, pointing out that the Pope has been spreading dissent in the provinces of his client duchies.\nChoose which side you wish to support in this matter, but know your decision could have a lasting impact.
Charlemagne awaits your reponse. His instruction is clear – you will convert to Christianity, or die. The decision is yours alone, yet the outcome will be far-reaching.
Our men are anxious at having to guard such heathens. You must now decide what to do with these captives. Your choice will decide not only their fate, but also your people’s opinions.
Tired of your endless raids, the king of Mercia, in England, has had enough, and is now seeking an arrangement by which these attacks will finally come to an end. He offers a plot of land within his own kingdom, or gold should you prefer it. Acceptance of this deal will mean peace between your two peoples, but of course you could accept it and betray him later! Perhaps he means to do the same\? However, should you wish it you can deny the English people mercy, continue on your profitable rampage and strike fear into the hearts of its people. The choice is yours!

An old man sits at the bank. If this riddle is solved, he promises to give Ri the Salmon of Knowledge, a manifestation of every truth in the universe - “I was an armed warrior. Now a bold young retainer covers me with gold and silver, and twisted coils of wire. Sometimes men kiss me; sometimes I call close comrades to battle with my voice.”
The old man shakes his head firmly – a druid was not the answer. The Ri goes on his way saddened, but is immediately distracted by the sight of a large black cat with a spot on its breast. It wanders up to the Ri with a certain insolence, demanding his attention. What does he do\?
The owner of the cat sees the Ri offering it a saucer of milk. Impressed by his kindness, she tells him of the head of a severed king in a nearby village. The head continually begs for water from a remote stream to salve its gaping neck. She offers the Ri a gold goblet and directions to the stream.
For three days the cat and the Ri have stood, eyes locked and unblinking. A small crowd has gathered to watch the battle of wills, and their cries fill his ears. Some insist it is Cat Sith and urge him to flee, while still others drive him on with words of encouragement.
Horn was correct! The old man hands the gleaming salmon over, but before the Ri can take a bite he is startled by the sight of a man perched in the branches of a tree. He claims he is Buile Shuibhne, a king cursed to live a half-avian life and driven to leap from tree to tree at the slightest noise.
Savouring his stolen salmon, the Ri wanders further down the bank. There he catches sight of a mysterious young woman tending to her horses. The Ri is in two minds. On the one hand, she might be a kelpie tending her malicious offspring. On the other, she might be a friendly young farmer.
The Ri comes across three sons of Tuireann, covered in blood and surrounded by villagers. They are accused of slaying Cian, a local king. They beg for mercy, claiming that he had taken the shape of a pig and was unrecognisable. If he lets them go, they claim, they will prove their innocence by retrieving his hide and demonstrating its magical powers.
As promised, the three sons of Tuireann return bearing a bloody pigskin. However, they have paid a heavy price - all three bear mortal wounds. They claim that the skin has potent healing powers and beg the Ri to bind their wounds in it. In return they promise to provide the answer to any question under the sun.
The heads of the brothers lie in the dust at the feet of the Ri. Impressed by your swift judgement the people bring another case before you. The man, Bres, is the king of an oppressive tribe bought low in a recent conflict. In return for his life, he offers you the secrets of fertility, guaranteeing you bountiful harvests and cows that never dry out.
Centuries of oppression and uncertainty have smothered the spirit of the Celtic people, but their glorious past, preserved in legend, provides the last glimmer of hope to a generation seeking a new beginning. At the ancient heart of the island, the young Ri departs, determined to discover the future in store for his people. He will find knowledge of it, or forge it himself!

Another family is seeking to adopt one of your sons as their own! Can you really afford to let your boy go\?
Treachery! Rumour has it that this man is plotting to assassinate a member of your family! There is little proof, but if you do not act the consequences could be dire.
The plot has failed, and the assassin's true colours have been revealed. His target is wounded, but alive. How you proceed now will determine whether or not the assassin remains that way…
You ignored the warnings, and noble blood has been spilled. All evidence points to this man's involvement. What will you do with him\?
An unscrupulous rival has spread foul rumours about a member of your family! Give the order and they will be silenced…
One of your daughters has been enticed by a suitor and is planning to elope. Should she be allowed to follow her heart\?
One of your subjects has recently become infatuated and wishes to marry his intended. Shall their union be allowed to continue\?
This man, hungry for power, has positioned himself to take office without your approval. He may be suited to the task, but can you afford to let his ambitions threaten your family's power\?
Chilibidius, as promised, has been brought before you and made to restate his position – he claims to be a Roman general of quite some prestige. If this is true, surely we would have heard of him before now\? All the same, he offers to curry favour with the Empire in our name if we allow him to return. Doubts and shadows abound, but the choice is ultimately yours…
Dire news, lord! Chilibidius, the slave general we recently sent back to Rome, has been proven nothing but a liar! Another slave in the camp testified, under pain of death, that this ‘Chilibidius’ is nothing but a rogue. He is well on his way to reaching Imperial territory, and it will be no easy feat, but we could still possibly intercept him before he reaches them.
As expected, lord, the Huns are here, and they do not mean to make niceties. They have their teeth bared for war, but so do we. The question now is how to fight them\? We could act defensively and have them crash uselessly against us – but they are many, and may find purchase by sheer numbers alone. Alternatively, we could attack first, striking with shock and speed. Both choices have advantages, but the decision is ultimately yours.
The relentless Huns are here, as predicted. All those who did not comply with their demands have met a gruesome fate. They make peaceful overtures, but do not misunderstand the truth behind their smiles - tribute is what they desire. We could pay them what they want, which will buy us time, but they will inevitably return and demand more. Who knows how much they will ask for next time\? Or, we could defy both them and fate, and refuse their demands. Either this could incite their anger, or our tenacity could earn their respect. The choice is yours, my lord, but be mindful that the Huns do not like to be kept waiting…
As expected, the Huns have returned. Not content with the ‘pittance’ we gave last time, they ride back to demand more of our livelihoods, more fruits of our hard-earned toil. Their demands are as harsh as ever, and the fire in their eyes says their conviction is not to be doubted. We could capitulate and pay, or we could stand resolute and defy them. The Huns are unforgiving, but we could make our own mark on history with their defeat…

In your splendid courts a young warrior, Ybor, grows restless. His heart yearns for the wilds, teeming with the great trials that earn a man repute, and he beseeches your permission to leave. Though his departure pains you, you know that he will return all the stronger, shaped by the choices he makes in his wanderings. What parting gift do you bestow\?

Sword at his hip, Ybor strides into the lush forests with an air of youthful invincibility. Before too long, his progress is arrested by the cries of men and the clash of steel - bandits are hacking their way through a crowd of travellers. Through the dust and blood, he spots a famous poet attempting to shield a priestess of Godan. Who does he save\?
With the brooch on his chest, Ybor sees the world with an icy clarity, marvelling at the familiar forest as if it were an entirely new landscape. Suddenly a tongue of fire flares in his path, siring an inferno that bars his way. A few farmers from the nearby village cower in fright, despite the threat to their crops.
In exchange for his life, the Poet bestows a silver tongue on Ybor, enabling him to weave a shimmering web of words around the hardest heart. Soon he finds himself leading a band of adventurers, attracted by word of his prowess. But fame begets jealousy; the brothers Ambri and Assi descend upon him at the head of a countless host, glittering with steel and malice.
In saving the priestess’ life and slaying the bandits, Ybor proved himself to be a manifestation of Godan, the god who holds life and death in one mighty palm. The priestess considers it her sacred duty to guide Ybor and enhance his destructive and healing powers by mystical means. However, unlike Godan, Ybor must choose just one path to tread. Which will it be\?
Ybor emerges from the fire unscathed, shielded by his faith in Godan. The farmers, witnesses of this miraculous act, spread the story far and wide, and soon he is beset with supplicants seeking his intervention. A plague has fallen on a nearby village and a local wise man has confirmed that Ybor alone can bring deliverance.
With the fire quelled, the farmers beg Ybor to return to the court of their king with them. They recount the tale of your valour and command to those assembled. The king recognises Ybor’s nobility and offers him a position as advisor. The priest of Godan, similarly impressed, courts him for the priesthood, offering to give divine weight to the words he utters.
