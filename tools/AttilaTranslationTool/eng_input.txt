"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_02"	"My people are not your shield. Are you so sunk in cowardice\? You are geldings indeed, then!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_demand_military_access_02"	"Our lands would never be rid of the stench. You may not march in them."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_demand_military_access_03"	"Your armies are not fit to march where our gods still live. You pollute their peace by even asking!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_01"	"Gold\? Is that all you value\? You shall have none from us, only rich contempt!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_02"	"We do not pay wolves to keep them from our flocks. When we can be bothered, we hunt them."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_hand_over_region_01"	"Do not ask such a thing! The gods are quick to anger, and will demand blood!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_hand_over_region_02"	"These lands can never be yours! The gods would tear you to pieces rather than see the people submit!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_hand_over_region_03"	"You\? Rule these...\? It is true then. Madness runs in your people. But... you don't foam at the mouth…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_01"	"What\? Such wit will one day surely cost you your head! Let me take it now, and save you trouble!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_02"	"Do I look like some civilized city whore\? Do I\? Well, why do you try to use me like one\?"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_05"	"What do we gain from this\? Friends\? No!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_06"	"You pitiful wretches have a sense of humour. I would as soon ally with week-dead fish. Their stink is better!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_02"	"Peace is not to our taste. We like the screams of your women! Not peace!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_04"	"My ancestors were quite… inventive with dolts like you. They used fire, and skinning knives. Peace\? I spit on you."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_05"	"What\? Peace\? When your skulls are as yet unstacked, and your women have yet to kill themselves in despair\?"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barb_hun_reject_hand_over_region_03"	"No. The sword can only be taken from our cold, dead hands."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_01"	"No, no, no. The gods would set a red plague upon us all if I agreed to such a thing."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_02"	"My people cannot accept such an thing. The gods would rightly curse us!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_03"	"My people deserve better of you than these words. Are we not warriors and men\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_04"	"I cannot take such an arrangement to my people, it would betray their faith in me to accept this."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_05"	"There is no joy in this. I see no gain in these terms for my people."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_07"	"This is not enough. I cannot take these terms before my people. You must do better."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_08"	"The gods will not allow this. For all its merits, it is not enough to calm them."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_09"	"To accept these terms would risk the wrath of my gods and my people. I cannot act on this."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_02"	"Our gods whisper to me that I must reject your offer, worthy though it was, and hope for something more."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_03"	"Your people are a byword for honour, but I cannot quite accept the terms that you offer."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_07"	"I cannot settle on such terms. Your people are worthy, but my people deserve better of our talk."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_08"	"The gods would be displeased if I said yes too easily, although you speak your part well."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_09"	"You have an honest tongue, and so I reject your offer hesitantly, and without wishing offence."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_generic_reject_respectful_10"	"You speak as well as a bard, but I must be unswayed by all except the interest of my people."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_request_peace_06"	"Do we fight until both of us are on our knees\? Our peoples deserve more! They deserve peace!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_request_trade_01"	"A river of goods and coin between our lands would surely see all prosper. Will you agree to trade\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_request_trade_02"	"All would surely benefit if we agreed to open trade from this day on. Well\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_offer_request_trade_03"	"We have fine goods and you doubtless have much that we would find desirable. So, are we to have trade\?"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_01"	"So… We fight your enemies while you hide, grow fat, and whore yourselves stupid. An excellent plan! Bah!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_02"	"My people are not your shield. Are you so sunk in cowardice\? You are geldings indeed, then!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_defend_against_faction_03"	"You have the courage to ask this, yet cannot pick a sword to defend yourselves properly\? Great gods!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_client_status_01"	"Us\? We should serve you\? As your tethered goats\? Your dogs\? Your slaves\? Your head injury goes unhealed, then!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_client_status_03"	"My people bow to man, least of all the snivelling, shit-biting weaklings that pass as your rulers!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_join_confederation_01"	"I will not hand over our people to your keeping. I would die of shame, and wander behind the winds, unlamented and cursed!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_join_confederation_02"	"Such grovelling would bring the fury of the gods upon us. And we would deserve their anger. As do you."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_join_confederation_03"	"Only a goat eats everything within reach! You were birthed by a goat! You smell like one as well!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_military_access_01"	"The gods and our ancestors long dead would strangle us in the night if we allowed such a stupidity!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_military_access_02"	"Our lands would never be rid of the stench. You may not march in them."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_military_access_03"	"Your armies are not fit to march where our gods still live. You pollute their peace by even asking!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_01"	"Gold\? Is that all you value\? You shall have none from us, only rich contempt!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_02"	"We do not pay wolves to keep them from our flocks. When we can be bothered, we hunt them."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_03"	"Spare you some gold\? You have so little honour, then, that you beg at table for scraps. Away, cur!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_01"	"The only gold I will give you is the piss from my slaves, and I begrudge you even that!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_02"	"The feeble and weak-willed may throw you meat, but we do not hold with feeding stray dogs."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_03"	"You think me a fool then\? Or my people\? Or our ancestors\? One coin, and your begging would never end!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_01"	"A fancy word for slavery! Keep your whips and chains for your own household, or your wife."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_02"	"We do not bow before foreign dogs. I would sooner throw my family into the flames than do such a thing!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_hand_over_region_01"	"Do not ask such a thing! The gods are quick to anger, and will demand blood!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_hand_over_region_02"	"These lands can never be yours! The spirits here would tear you to pieces rather than see the people submit!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_hand_over_region_03"	"You\? Rule these...\? It is true then. Madness runs in your people. But... you don't foam at the mouth…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_01"	"What\? Such wit will one day surely cost you your head! Let me take it now, and save you trouble!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_02"	"Do I look like some civilized city whore\? Do I\? Well, why do you try to use me like one\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_03"	"Ally with gutless wonders such as you\? My people deserve better. You deserve a spear point for the idea."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_04"	"We do not need to cower behind your shield, for we are warriors not weaklings. Look to your own defences!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_05"	"What do we gain from this\? Friends\? No. Feeble-minded fools unable to mate with goats without mucking it up!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_06"	"You pitiful wretches have a sense of humour. I would as soon ally with week-dead fish. Their stink is better!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_01"	"Peace\? Peace\? I laugh at your peace! We do not make peace with fish-faced fools!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_02"	"Peace is not to our taste. The sword is different! And ale! And the screams of your women! Not peace!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_03"	"Peace\? Be grateful I do not have your peaceful tongue ripped from your head for speaking such a word!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_04"	"My ancestors were quite… inventive with dolts like you. They used fire, and skinning knives. Peace\? I spit on you."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_05"	"What\? Peace\? When your skulls are as yet unstacked, and your women have yet to kill themselves in despair\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_06"	"I cannot stomach your cowardice. Your people will have peace. When they are all stacked on the funeral pyres!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_01"	"Trade\? Do you think us children, flattered and distracted by your pretty beads\? Bah!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_02"	"Your coins have your ugly-faced rulers on them. None of my people want them in their purses."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_03"	"You think to turn our heads with your unholy trinkets\? Save them for the little boys you favour…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_01"	"So, you think we will sell ourselves, like your women\? You are truly mad, then, or stupid!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02"	"Keep your money. You will need it to pay your way to the afterlife. And it is tainted anyway…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03"	"It takes more than your stolen gold to win our favour. Give it to your remarkably foul gods!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_01"	"Be grateful that you are not eating this mighty treasure, piece by piece, with boiled leeks. You insult honour!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_03"	"Your money may win favour among whores but we will not be used for your filthy pleasure."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_attack_faction_01"	"Our warriors are needed elsewhere, and even the sharpest sword cannot be thrust into two enemies at once."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_attack_faction_02"	"The spirits tell us that our warriors cannot be wasted on these dogs. You must tame them without us."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_attack_faction_03"	"The wise have spoken. There is glory in it what you ask, but our path goes a different way."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_defend_against_faction_01"	"The plan is good, but we cannot send warriors to help in defence. Our wise women have spoken against it."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_defend_against_faction_02"	"I will not be a mouth-friend, to promise much and give little. We cannot help. You must stand without us."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_defend_against_faction_03"	"My people cannot move at every wolf howl. We wait to see what the pack is doing."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_client_status_01"	"Our gods would weep, and rightly, to see us give up our freedom and become your dogs."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_client_status_02"	"I will not offer up my people as sacrifices to your glory. Ancestors! Strike me down if I ever do!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_client_status_03"	"I will never as my people to bow to you. Never. Our hard-won freedom remains ours!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_join_confederation_01"	"We value our freedom, my friend. We cannot set it aside and no longer be counted free men!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_join_confederation_02"	"My people still have the strength to stand alone, and the stubbornness to reject such an offer."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_join_confederation_03"	"We are set in our ways, for they served us and our ancestors well. We cannot join with you."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_military_access_01"	"Our gods taught us some wisdom.  Armies can quickly turn to conquerors once they are inside the gates."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_military_access_02"	"No. The ancestors would sleep poorly if your men were tramping across our lands."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_military_access_03"	"The wise man closes his hall doors in winter, and keeps out the fierce winds that blow."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_regular_payment_01"	"I had not realised that your people were reduced to begging for scraps at others' doors."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_regular_payment_02"	"Ah, friend, by the spirits this is sorrowful. I was about to ask you the same thing!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_regular_payment_03"	"Your war-chest may be empty, but you look to the wrong men if you hope to fill it."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_single_payment_01"	"Ha! Away with your foolishness, before you feel a golden boot at your arse, emissary or no!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_single_payment_02"	"The spirits would not let me rest easily if I gave you money and, in the doing, took honour."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_single_payment_03"	"Where have you put your people's pride\? Is it eaten by wolves, or pecked away by carrion birds\? Gold\? No."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_vassal_status_01"	"No! I would not give over even the meanest of our people to your considerate mastery."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_vassal_status_02"	"My ancestors roil in their sleep! That such an offer is made... I must reject your demand."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_demand_vassal_status_03"	"Where is worth in this\? You gain rebellion, dissent and bitterness within your walls. We gain nothing."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_hand_over_region_01"	"I think not. Blood and treasure brought us those lands, and we value them."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_hand_over_region_02"	"No, no, no. The spirits of those lands would be unhappy if we left. We have a duty to them."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_hand_over_region_03"	"We hold what we have grasped. The sword and shield can only be taken from our cold, dead hands."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_01"	"A man is judged by his friends. This is not the time for such an agreement."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_02"	"I cannot say "Yes" and be anything but a mouth-friend. That sits ill with me, so I say "No"."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_03"	"Your offer was kindly, but we have no need to share glory, ale or good pork with you."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04"	"I thank you for the offer, but we are not wet nurses for weaklings."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05"	"Our ancestors were proud men, and stood alone against the world. For now, can we do any less\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06"	"The man who hangs upon the shield of another is nothing but a burden."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_01"	"Ah, you joke, even in this! I admire your people for their sense of humour!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_02"	"You are a funny little man. And we do listen to what funny little men want."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_03"	"Silence has not yet fallen. It is not the season for peace."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_04"	"I expected such an offer, but not so soon. My people still enjoy the taste of glory…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_05"	"This is not a time of peace. When the trees sleep, when the moon has waxed and waned, then, maybe…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_peace_06"	"Our gods do not want peace. Our gods want blood! And honour! And sacrifice! We do what the gods ask…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_trade_01"	"I do not think our people want your trinkets. They like honest, manly stuff for the most part."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_trade_02"	"I am sure that your wares will find a home somewhere, but not with us…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_demand_trade_03"	"Your goods... well, no.  We see little gain in trade between our peoples."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_regular_payment_01"	"I am sure that money means a great deal to you. But we value honour, and honesty, and glory!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_regular_payment_02"	"Our ancestors were never beggars or servants. And we will not become your paid hirelings."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_regular_payment_03"	"We are not farmhands or hired killers, to be given a little bread in exchange for obedience."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_01"	"You have the heart of a merchant, my friend. A merchant. We do not want your gold."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_02"	"A tidy sum, to be sure, but our hearts are full of courage, not lust for gold."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_reject_offer_single_payment_03"	"Our ancestors would be shamed if even one of your coins was accepted. They were proud, our ancestors…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_01"	"Our ancestors are restless! Please, get your soldiers off our lands or suffer the endless curses of our honoured dead!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_03"	"Your armies must leave our lands. The stench alone causes sows to miscarry, and all our sheep look nervous!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_attack_faction_01"	"We do not ask it lightly, but the gods favour it: an attack on these people would aid our cause!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_attack_faction_02"	"You have been blessed with courage, so will you not use that courage to help us\? Attack these people!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_attack_faction_03"	"Can you spare men to cut a few throats\? These people need death. They would welcome it at your hands…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_defend_against_faction_01"	"I speak now of our need for more warriors, to defend against these people. What aid can you send\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_defend_against_faction_02"	"Dogs circle us and bare their teeth. We need a friend or two to watch our backs…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_defend_against_faction_03"	"Will you send aid\? A wise man looks to his brother to bring a bucket when the floods come!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_get_military_off_my_land_01"	"Our gods grow weary of your soldiers' tread! As you value friendship, remove your men from our lands."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_get_military_off_my_land_02"	"Your warriors can march in our lands no longer. The spirits have spoken clearly on this matter."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_barbarian_request_get_military_off_my_land_03"	"We have been quiet for a long time, but now it is time for your warriors to go home."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_generic_reject_06"	"My friend, I had not noticed my feathers, for surely you think me a carrion bird, to offer such scraps!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_01"	"Let there be peace, I beg. Surely now there has been enough bloodshed and misery\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_02"	"Do you have enough glory to be merciful\? Can I ask for peace, and hope for its coming\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_03"	"My lord accepts that you are a worthy foe, but the time has come to set aside swords."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_04"	"We have all asked much of our warriors. Now, I beg, let us give them rest."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_05"	"Our enemies watch with glee while we bleed in the uncaring dust. Shall we spite our foes, and have peace\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_beg_peace_06"	"I plead for peace, not from cowardice but from concern. If we fight on, only our rivals profit…"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_hand_over_region_02"	"These lands would, I think, flourish under your stewardship. We say  claim them as your own!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_hand_over_region_03"	"These people are not natural subjects to my master. Perhaps they will do better beneath your whips…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_regular_payment_01"	"If you will allow me a small joke, I trust that your treasurer will not mind counting the money!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_offer_regular_payment_02"	"Our lands have riches beyond imagining, which is why we can afford to share some of our good fortune."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_01"	"A thousand apologies, but such help as we could offer would arrive too late and be of little use."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_02"	"We can do little against these people. Our wise men have read the flames, and see no good in them."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_attack_faction_03"	"We cannot. Our armies are but cunning shadows for our defence, not for rash attacks."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_client_status_02"	"An offer so pregnant with sincerity is not lightly refused, but this one must be. My master cannot agree."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_client_status_03"	"There is little merit in such an arrangement for my people. I can see the appeal of the idea to you…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_military_access_01"	"I am sorry, my friend, but our gods would be much offended by the presence of your soldiers."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_military_access_02"	"My lord is brave, warlike and enjoys the manly company of soldiers, but not of your soldiers."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_military_access_03"	"Our gates must remain closed and barred, even to your glorious armies."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_01"	"I think not. Our gold would outshine your other treasures' worth a thousand fold, and you would feel shame."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_02"	"I am sure your needs are urgent, but my lord cannot give away gold he holds in trust."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_regular_payment_03"	"We do not give subsidies to passing acquaintances. Perhaps that is why our treasury bulges!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_single_payment_01"	"Scant respect would be yours if friendship is purchased! We hold you in much higher regard!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_single_payment_02"	"We would find beggars at the gates every day if we gave you money. I fear we must refuse."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_single_payment_03"	"Ah, my friend, you ask too much. Gold is happiest with gold it knows, not in a stranger's vaults."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_01"	"I cannot agree, my friend. Chance may have been unkind, but the gods have yet to finish their game!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_02"	"This is not a sensible proposition. Perhaps you have a stolen camel you want me to buy instead\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_demand_vassal_status_03"	"I had not noticed that the gods had cursed us, and ordered that we were to be your chattel goods."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_hand_over_region_01"	"My master will not hand over one stone, let alone a province because you or anyone else asks politely."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_02"	"You have a determined tongue but there is no profit in what you suggest."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_03"	"Friendship does not rely on a form of words, my friend. It is found in deeds."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04"	"You show much wisdom in seeking us as friends, but we must rely on our own strength."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05"	"A treaty is not to my master's taste today. He is not in an understanding vein."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06"	"The merits of a treaty seem to favour you above us. That I cannot accept."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_01"	"You may well talk of peace! I myself have asked for the moon and stars and a silent mother-in-law!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_02"	"By the flame, you have a fool's courage! Your peace is a shiny trinket, and finds no buyer here!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_03"	"The gods blessed you with some good sense. Unfortunately for you, they gave us scant forgiveness."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_04"	"You dangle peace before us: a pretty trinket. But glory, that magnificent treasure, is within our grasp!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_05"	"Your plea for mercy is well spoken, but not pleasing to our ears. The war continues."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_peace_06"	"There has been much blood, it is true. Now you ask for peace. We, however, find profit in blood."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_trade_01"	"The gods rightly wish us to show humility, and not enrich ourselves at your expense."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_trade_02"	"Our merchants do not want trade with you. And my master takes note of their undoubted expertise."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_demand_trade_03"	"Trade with you is, I am sorry to say, all but impossible. Our merchants have business elsewhere."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_regular_payment_01"	"My friend, our coffers already overflow with wealth from all corners of the world. We need no more!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_regular_payment_02"	"Your intent here is plain, but to accept your money would put us, ever-so-slightly, in your debt."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_regular_payment_03"	"My people have riches enough. Your gesture is polite, but not needed."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_single_payment_01"	"Your generosity is astounding, remarkable and, sadly, unneeded. My lord cannot be bought like a camel in the market."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_single_payment_02"	"Your generous nature does your people credit, but really such a thing is not necessary."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_reject_offer_single_payment_03"	"You have an honest face, even as you offer an honest bribe. I must, in all politeness, refuse."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_01"	"Remove your men from our lands at once, lest our gods are roused and our people, in fear, demand action!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_angry_get_military_off_my_land_02"	"We have tolerated the stink of your armies long enough. Now, remove them from our lands!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_attack_faction_02"	"If you strike the blow will be unexpected and all the stronger for it! Can you not march\?"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_defend_against_faction_01"	"Can you not see, my good friend, that defence against these beasts is a necessity\? Will you help\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_defend_against_faction_02"	"We find ourselves facing mountain wolves, and would welcome an extra sword or two in our defence!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_defend_against_faction_03"	"You have a chance here to prove that there is no greater loyalty than to friends in need!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_get_military_off_my_land_01"	"My lord has ordered me to remove your soldiers from his land, and therefore I say they must go."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_get_military_off_my_land_02"	"We weary of being good hosts to your armies. Have them march away while we still have some wine!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_get_military_off_my_land_03"	"Your armies do little to calm the nerves of my master. He asks that they be removed."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_hand_over_region_01"	"My lord has ordered me to ask a simple question, with a simple answer: will you hand over these lands\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_hand_over_region_02"	"Will you give over these lands to my master, so that proper profit can be earned from them\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_hand_over_region_03"	"There are a thousand reasons why these lands should be ours. Well\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_military_access_01"	"My friend, my lord wishes to use your lands as a highway, a road to his rightful destination, nothing more…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_military_access_02"	"My master’s armies will soon be at your gates. They merely pass through, hunting other game…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_military_access_03"	"Our armies will march beneath a banner of peace in your lands. It is our rivals who should know fear!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_player_must_become_vassal_01"	"See reason, my friend, and follow a profitable course. My lord is a noble master, and rewards loyalty."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_regular_payment_02"	"A regular reminder of friendship, perhaps in gold, would keep you ever in my master's thoughts."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_regular_payment_03"	"My master likes to think well of his friends. And their gold... Mostly of their gold…"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_single_payment_01"	"There is much to be said for generosity between friends. It profits both parties, don't you agree\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_single_payment_02"	"I will be honest. I seek coin as token of your good and continued friendship."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_single_payment_03"	"My honourable master would have me talk of gold. A lump sum would ensure his good opinion."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_state_gift_01"	"Let it be understood that simple tribute honours both you, as giver, and my master."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_eastern_request_state_gift_02"	"My master is accustomed to gifts worthy of his magnificence. I hope you have such a gift…"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_counter_reject_03"	"I will speak as our noble Emperor would desire and, finding little worth in your words, decline."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_christian_counter_reject_04"	"The Emperor's will is clear in this matter, and your proposal has little worthy of agreement."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_02"	"Our physicians have leeches enough to bleed us without needing a nation of such creatures giving suck!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_regular_payment_03"	"Bandit! Thief! Whoremonger! You cannot dip your hand into our purse on a whim!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_01"	"You expect golden trinkets to adorn your wives! Those perfidious harpies normally settle for a little blood!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_02"	"Our purse is not to be plundered to satisfy the over-confident greed of brigands and vagabonds!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_single_payment_03"	"You are most insolent, and here insolence is usually repaid with the whip!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_01"	"The man who could obey one of you without vomiting through contempt has yet to be born!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_demand_vassal_status_02"	"You expect us to be your catamites and whores\? Slavery will never be our lot!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_hand_over_region_03"	"This is insanity! Rome will not loosen her grip on any lands for you!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_01"	"Perhaps I should form an alliance with slaves in my vineyards\? Or with passing lepers\? Bah!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_02"	"Lacking a blind, insane or diseased man to agree with your proposal, you will have to look elsewhere!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_05"	"You seek a good marriage with us, and yet you have only the charm of an uncommonly ugly fishwife!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_cooperation_06"	"I can almost hear the laughter of the Gods. You have stupidity that would pass for courage to ask such a thing!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_01"	"Peace\? Peace\? Peace! Do you think us ruled by old women and dotards unable to lift the sword\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_02"	"Our wits are not entirely fled, our courage not entirely spent, and you still rut in your hovels! Peace\? Pah!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_03"	"You speak of peace when our blood cries out for vengeance and Legionary swords are not yet blunted with killing\? Never!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_04"	"You want an end to this\? I am not surprised, your weakness of stomach is well known."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_05"	"Our Legions will go on spilling your blood. It is of no use inside you, after all!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_peace_06"	"Your demands are weak and feeble-minded. Once roused, our hunger for blood is bottomless!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_01"	"Wash your goods in vinegar to remove the stench and, even then, our merchants would not waste their coin!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_02"	"You may love a good haggling like women over onions and goats and fish. We have a state to run!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_demand_trade_03"	"We have no taste for your repulsive, ill-made trinkets and sullied goods."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_01"	"Your virtue may be available in the market, but honesty is prized above any coin."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_02"	"Pah! We are not common mercenaries, to be bought with your bread, salt and coin!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_regular_payment_03"	"We find no pleasure in taking your gold except, perhaps, from your burning homes!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_01"	"We are not whores and costermongers to be bought for a handful of coin."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_02"	"You insult us twice over in one babbling utterance! We do not want your gold, or so little of it!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_angry_offer_single_payment_03"	"The people would see me experience the lictors' whips if I accepted your crude offer!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_attack_faction_01"	"Such an attack might be prudent, but I do not believe the consuls will make troops available."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_defend_against_faction_01"	"I do not think that the people would approve of troops being used like that. They would think it unmanly."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_defend_against_faction_02"	"Such a plan cannot be countenanced at the moment. You must act without us."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_defend_against_faction_03"	"We have no wish to see these lands suffer a conqueror's tread, yet we cannot march to defend them."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_regular_payment_01"	"Merchants do not rule here, and so we do not pay taxes to others."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_regular_payment_02"	"Sadly, our coffers will remain firmly closed. Our gold does not travel well."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_single_payment_01"	"Our coinage sits ill in foreign, duplicitous purses. Or so I am told."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_single_payment_02"	"We do not open our purse to fill the bowl of a passing beggar."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_vassal_status_01"	"I cannot think of a Roman who would endure such a forced marriage and not kill himself within a day!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_vassal_status_02"	"Why, in God's name, would the people wish to punish honesty\? So, I say in their name: no!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_demand_vassal_status_03"	"What\? Shackle ourselves like common slaves\? Are you are aware that you address a Roman\?"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_hand_over_region_01"	"I am reasonably confident that the Senate and People of Rome would have me say "no" to this ridiculous suggestion."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_hand_over_region_02"	"I can safely speak for all Rome in this matter, and say that such a change of ownership is a not going to happen just yet."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_hand_over_region_03"	"Rome holds those lands fondly to her bosom. The suggestion that they be handed has scant merit."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_01"	"We thrive in foreign ventures only when such works are subject to sensible direction."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_02"	"The state's defences do not need another ditch, and we do not hide behind others."	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_04"	"Thank you, but the state has no need of defenders at the moment. They have the Legions at their backs!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_05"	"We see no merit in such a marriage between states. We will stand, properly virginal, without you!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_cooperation_06"	"We are strong enough alone. We must decline, then, but the Consul will note your offer with due respect."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_01"	"The gods would turn their backs on us if I heeded this foolish, weakling's proposal."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_02"	"Our righteous anger is not yet spent. Peace does not interest the state, nor does it interest me!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_03"	"Stop the Legions\? I fear not. Our men must have their glory and plunder!"	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_demand_peace_04"	"We will not accept such a thing. Our soldiers hunger for glory and are not done feasting!"	"True"

"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_regular_payment_03"	"A worthy gesture, but one that is declined. We can only wonder what lies behind such a gift."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_single_payment_01"	"A gold coin cannot turn aside all the swords of the state, or change the people's worthy opinion."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_single_payment_02"	"Our favour is neither sold nor bought with your coin."	"True"
"diplomacy_strings_string_rome_reject_offer_single_payment_03"	"Such gifts often come with a heavy price. We must decline your kind offer."	"True"
